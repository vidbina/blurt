The big boy says you're tweeting; Facebook calls it writing on a wall, Myspace labels it "What are you doing right now?", Hyves calls it "WieWatWaar's". Even Google couldn't ignore the micro-blogging fad and threw its Buzz into the mix.

There are many social profiling sites that offer some form of micro-blogging. In most cases the messages have to be around 140 characters in length and could describe a thought, state, place or whatever else you feel like unearthing to the curious eyes that comprise your audience. <br /><br />Twitter is one of the best known name in microblogging, mostly because it is very mobile. Every mobile phone in circulation has some way to get on twitter. UberTwitter, Echofon, Snaptu, Twitdroid... These four application can nearly cover the scope of all mobile phone with internet capabilities. UberTwitter on BlackBerry, Echofon on the iPhone, Twitdroid on Android and, my favorite, Snaptu for practically any phone in existence.<br /><br />That is why I have facebook, myspace, hyves and many other sites linked to my twitter. Anything I say on twitter is reposted as a writing on my wall on Facebook, a WWW on Hyves, a Buzz on Google or a "What are you doing right now?" post on Myspace. The simple trick is setting the deal up.<br /><br /><strong>Facebook</strong><br /><br />In FB you can use different Applications to get certain things done. Use the <em>twitter</em> app to connect your fb page to your twitter. After giving the right user credentials it is possible to change some basic settings to dictate how the app should respond to tweets.

From the first time I heard [Laura Mvula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Mvula)
I believed in angels :angel:. No seriously, her voice is celestial, especially
in combination with her glorious orchestral arrangements and angelic harmonies.

Yesterday, I stumbled upon her latest masterpiece in collaboration with the
great musician/producer [Nile Rodgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_Rodgers).

All the brilliance in the musical elements aside, the message, woven into the
fabric of the song, appeals to us humans to pursue dreams and goals regardless
of otherwise limiting circumstances with simple phrases as

> Take your broken wings and fly

> Take your broken feet and run

We're all urged to get going and overcome.

> 'Round the mountain, all God's children run -- All God's children run 'round
> the mountain run

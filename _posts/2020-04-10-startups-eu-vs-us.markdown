<!-- Eli: Why, not like it used to? -->
<!-- Eli: Give more examples -->
A friend recently asked why America consistently churns out startups that
seem to be succesful to an extent that knows no equal in Europe.

The following is just a sampling of some notable startups that hailed from
European soil:
- Adyen (payment)
- Deliveroo (food delivery)
- Klarna (payment)
- Rovio (games)
- Shazam (song detection and streaming)
- Skype (videoconferencing)
- Skyscanner (travel, flight booking)
- Spotify (streaming, audio)
- Supercell (games)
- Takeaway.com (food delivery)
- Zalando (retail)

To be fair, neither of these companies operate in the same league as the
American top startups and I would argue that this likely boils down to the
access to capital, venture capital in particular, and culture.

<div class="element note">
An interesting idea to entertain is that it may be benefits to an ecosystem
that is comprised of smaller startups instead of behemoths that we witness
arise out of the US. I'm a fan of smaller competing or collaborating firms and
keeping each other in check instead of monopolies that absorb anything that
poses a remote risk. This, however; is a topic for another post.

## Venture Capital

Europe doesn't have venture capital like it used to. During the Age of
Exploration, explorers ventured into the unknown with the financial backing of
the elite. During the Industrial Age, money seemed to find its way to the
machine builders and inventors which in turn helped Europe maintain its
relevance by establishing it as an industrial power. The Information Age has
produced some wins as previously mentioned but few to none of those wins
managed to capture their audiences as well as some of the popular American
names.

I've been through a few cohorts at accelerators in Europe and have witnessed a
bunch of my peers maneuver the fund-raise dance both in Europe and in America
to vastly different results. Some ideas that were deemed nearly "unfundable"
here in Europe have found fertile soil in the US in order to grow on to build
sustainable businesses or flop.

Slowly but surely, European investors are catching on which can be observed in
the ever growing number of money that is invested in European ventures.
Crunchbase [reports][cb-vc] 17.7B USD being invested in EU startups in 2015
while they tracked about twice as much, 36B USD, being invested in 2019.
Statista provides data on the [number of investments][statista-num] and the
[sum of investments][statista-sum] in Europe which support the notion that the
funding situation is improving. Dealroom [reports][dealroom] 18.5B EUR invested
in 2015 and reports a steady growth in invested capital up to 27.8B EUR
invested in 2018.

At some point, one can only hope that the greater access to capital will allow
founders to build solutions that are taken a bit further in order to compete
with that which is produced across the Atlantic.

## Culture

With multiple countries, languages and distinct cultures, Europe is somewhat of
a challenging sandbox in which to grow a startup. I would go as far to argue
that America, with all its differences between the two coastlines, is arguably
more homogenous in a cultural sense than a similarly sized chunk of Europe.

In the parts of Western Europe that I've spent most time in, prudency is hailed
as a virtue. As a generalization one may note that the Dutch[^1] joke about
their Calvinistic tendencies and although I rip at the Dutch, this is a
tendency that I've experienced in multiple parts of the continent. While the
European is busy conducting cost-benefit analysis, an American somewhere has
already dispatched capital and put folks to work to find a solution. Perhaps
such American founders will fail disproportionately more to their European
counterparts but if new functional concepts arise from experimentation
increasing the number of experiments will at some point likely result to a
greater number of wins. This idea doesn't quite gel with the flavor of
risk-averseness commonly served in Europe although cues are being taken from
Sillicon Valley and other startup havens in order to develop a tolerance for
experimentation and "failure".

[^1]: Carry a Dutch passport so I'm kind of ripping at my own folks here :wink:.

Somehow I tend to get the sense that Americans, in general, think a bit bigger
than their European peers. I often consider this a feature or component of
American culture that may play a role in explaining the differences in the
types of startups that both ecosystems produce. It takes Americans to propose a
concept for a car that, to an European, effectively feels like a house on
wheels on account of its sheer size. You travel to America to find portions
that are overdimensioned for the European stomach with names such as "Big
Gulps" and other "Supersize"-ed food options. Big is almost synonymous with
America. Furthermore, reasoning about serving a quarter billion people is
different in The United States as opposed to Europe. This exercise in Europe
would require consideration for internationalization (languages, notation
systems, etc), cultural differences and regulatory aspects in order to achieve
a similar scale. This presents another challenge for European startups that may
not always be trivial to resolve.

Finally, it seems that America and Europe exhibit different leanings on the
individualism-to-collectivism spectrum. Europeans tend to recognize the central
role that collectivism seems to play in some Asian societies but often gloss
over the notion that "the self" fills a seemingly more subdued role in Europe
as opposed to the US. Perhaps our political history has something to do with
this -- Europe has arguably experimented with collectivist political ideology
more than America has. For now, types such as Steve Jobs and Elon Musk have
become somewhat of an American phenomenon. Visionaries with notable quirks and
dysfunctions that manage to motivate hordes of talented folks towards a
single-minded goal find more fertile ground in the US. I would suppose that a
culture so willing to celebrate individualism and self-made-ness as America
does, will breed many more of such visionarie while Europe is engaging in
more design by consensus endeavors. I would assume that the types of ventures
that will stem from more collectivist minds may be considerably different to
the types of ventures that stem from more invididualism-favoring systems but
now that we're finally noticing the funds stream into the startup sector, we
can expect some interesting developments over the coming years.

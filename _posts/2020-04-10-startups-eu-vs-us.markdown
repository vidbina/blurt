title: Why Europe Doesn't Produce Big Tech Like the USA
description: |
  America :us: has produced companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and
  Microsoft, while Europe doesn't quite seem to have comparable Big Tech
  companies? :trophy: Why is that? :thinking:

A friend recently asked why America churns out startups that seem to be
successful to an extent that knows no equal in Europe.

I would argue that this largely boils down to the access to capital, venture
capital in particular, and culture. At the same time, it needs to be noted that
Europe does have its share of startup wins that at least deserve a brief
mention in this post before rambling on about why America seems more fertile
for startups to thrive.

Notable European startups (some of which aren't European anymore :stuck_out_tongue:):
- Adyen (payment) :credit_card:
- Deliveroo (food delivery) :bento:
- Klarna (payment) :credit_card:
- Rovio (games) :video_game:
- Shazam (song detection and streaming) :musical_score: :iphone:
- Skype (videoconferencing) :video_camera: :phone:
- Skyscanner (travel, flight booking) :airplane:
- Spotify (streaming, audio) :musical_note: :headphones:
- Supercell (games) :video_game:
- Takeaway.com (food delivery) :bento:
- Zalando (retail) :dress: :necktie: :shoe: :jeans: :handbag:

<div class="element note">
An interesting idea to entertain is that it may be benefits to an ecosystem
that is comprised of smaller startups instead of the behemoths that we witness
hailing from the US. I'm a fan of smaller competing or collaborating firms and
keeping each other in check instead of monopolies that absorb anything that
poses a remote risk. This, however; is a topic for another post.

## Venture Capital

Europe doesn't have venture capital like it used to. During the Age of
Exploration, explorers ventured into the unknown with the financial backing of
the elite. During the Industrial Age, money seemed to find its way to the
machine builders and inventors which in turn helped Europe maintain its
relevance by establishing it as an industrial power. The Information Age has
produced some wins as previously mentioned but few to none of those wins
managed to capture their audiences as well as some of the popular American
names.

I've been through a few cohorts at accelerators in Europe and have witnessed a
bunch of my peers maneuver the fund-raise dance both in Europe and in America
to vastly different results. Some ideas that were deemed nearly "nonfundable"
here in Europe have found funding in the US in order to grow on to build
sustainable businesses or flop. :money_with_wings:

</div>

Slowly but surely, European investors are catching on which can be observed in
the ever growing number of money that is invested in European ventures.
Crunchbase [reports][cb-vc] 17.7B USD being invested in EU startups in 2015
while they tracked about twice as much, 36B USD, being invested in 2019.
Statista provides data on the [number of investments][statista-num] and the
[sum of investments][statista-val] in Europe which support the notion that the
funding situation is improving. Dealroom [reports][dealroom] 18.5B EUR invested
in 2015 and reports a steady growth in invested capital up to 27.8B EUR
invested in 2018. Assuming that each source keeps consistent definitions for
statups and investments year-over-year, it seems evident that the influx of
capital to European startups has been ramping up. :moneybag:

At some point, one can only hope that the greater access to capital will allow
founders to build solutions that are taken a bit further in order to compete
with that which is produced across the Atlantic.

## Culture

With multiple countries, languages and distinct cultures, Europe is somewhat of
a challenging, culturally heterogeneous, sandbox in which to grow a startup. I
would go as far to argue that America, with all its differences between the two
coastlines, is arguably more homogeneous in a cultural sense than a similarly
sized chunk of Europe.

Those observations aside, I would consider the
- tolerance for risk,
- bias towards big think,
- individualistic leanings and
- willingness or daringness to cooperate

as notable cultural factors that may provide some explanation as to why America
seems fertile ground for [Big Tech][bigtech][^bt] startups.

### Risk
In the parts of Western Europe that I've spent most time in, prudence is hailed
as a virtue. As a generalization one may note that the Dutch[^1] joke about
their Calvinistic tendencies and although I rip at the Dutch, this is a
tendency that I've experienced in multiple parts of the continent. While the
European is busy conducting cost-benefit analysis, an American somewhere has
already dispatched capital and put folks to work to find a solution. Perhaps
such American founders will fail disproportionately more to their European
counterparts but if new functional concepts arise from experimentation, it
follows that increasing the number of experiments will at some point result to
a greater number of wins. This idea doesn't quite gel with the flavor of
risk-aversion commonly served in Europe although cues are being taken from
Silicon Valley and other startup havens in order to develop a tolerance for
experimentation and "failure". Notably this risk-aversion is not only a
challenge among the investment climate but arguable also in the labor market
where it may be challenging to entice folks with the promise of shares in the
risk and rewards. I often wonder if the presence of our safety nets have some
role to play in this, or perhaps we designed those safety nets because we are
so risk-averse? :thinking: One could argue that the presence of safety nets
should simplify or even encourage the taking risk given the comfort of knowing
that on can only fall so far, but that again could be a completely separate
post.

[^1]: I carry a Dutch passport so I'm kind of ripping at my own folks here. :wink:

### Big Think
Somehow I tend to get the sense that Americans, in general, think a bit bigger
than their European peers. I often consider this a feature or component of
American culture that may play a role in explaining the differences in the
types of startups that both ecosystems produce. It took Americans to propose a
concept for a car that, to an European, effectively feels like a house on
wheels. It is in America where one finds portions that are over-dimensioned for
the European stomach such as the "Big Gulp" and other "Supersized" food items.
Big is almost synonymous with America and America has not just applied this to
object but equally enthusiastically to ideas as well. Furthermore, reasoning
about serving a quarter billion people is different in The United States as
opposed to Europe.  This exercise in Europe would require consideration for
internationalization (languages, notation systems, etc.), cultural differences
and regulatory aspects in order to achieve a similar scale. This presents
another challenge for European startups that may not always be trivial to
resolve.

### Individualism and Collectivism
America and Europe seem to exhibit different leanings on the
individualism-to-collectivism spectrum. Europeans tend to recognize the central
role that collectivism seems to play in some Asian societies and simultaneously
often seem gloss over the notion that "the self" fills a seemingly more subdued
role in Europe as opposed to the US. Europe's political history may have
something to do with its predominantly collectivist leanings but that topic is
definitely out of scope for this post[^2]. For now, types such as Steve Jobs,
Bill Gates and Elon Musk have become somewhat of an American phenomenon. Even
some of Europe's notable tech leaders, such as [Linus Torvalds][linus] (creator
of Linux, the operating system that runs the web :smirk:) and [Guido van
Rossum][guido] (creator of Python, the language that enables rapid development
and machine learning), have relocated to the United States. Supposedly, a
culture so eager to celebrate individualism and support such dreamers in a
manner like America, will enable many more of such visionaries to do what other
deem "crazy". Meanwhile, Europe's different mindset could give birth to
ventures of a considerably different nature. Since funds are more readily
streaming into the European startup sector, we can expect some interesting
developments over the coming years.

[^2]: Europe has arguably experimented with collectivist political ideology more than America has.

### Collaboration
For its individualistic-leanings, the American startup space has managed to
prove rich with collaboration. Founders will readily find themselves good
mentors to help their businesses forward, especially around the Silicon Valley
region, which [Quartz][qz] referred to as the "Pay-it-forward" mentality. [Leon
Pals][leonpals] reminded me of Steve Jobs walking away with some Xerox
technologies which exemplifies that spirit of collaboration. Collaboration
wasn't always amicable, however; and it wasn't rare for collaborators to become
competitors just like Steve Jobs' collaboration with Bill Gates eventually
evolved into a passioned battle between opponents. Over time, many companies
have found themselves relocating to the west coast in order to benefit from the
multitude of ideas, capital and willingness to collaborate. The tension that
may have stemmed from collaborations that evolved into rivalries may have been
a catalyst in keeping Silicon Valley tech firms on edge.

## Conclusion

Culture and capital may be notable factors in explaining why Europe hasn't been
able to produce tech ventures at the scale observed in the US. The changing
investment climate, however; may yet result to more changes on this front,
although I would expect the cultural factors to remain a challenge for a while.

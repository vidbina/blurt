title: Why Europe Doesn't Produce Big Tech Like the USA
description: |
  America :us: has produced companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and
  Microsoft, while Europe doesn't quite seem to have comparable Big Tech
  companies? :trophy: Why is that? :thinking:

A [friend][eli] recently asked why America churns out startups that seem to be
successful to an extent that knows no equal in Europe.

It's difficult to discuss how-to's on growing a national (or larger) startup
ecosystem without mentioning Israel, a nation that has managed to produce a
dazzling amount of tech ventures for its relatively small population. Around
the time I graduated college and started getting introduced to the Dutch
startup scene, I got my hands on [Startup Nation][sn] by Dan Senor and Saul
Singer which provided interesting insights to how _access to capital_ as well
as _cultural aspects_ enabled Israel to take such a dominant role in tech.
Military service[^idf], the risk-averseness introduced by immigrants and
_chutzpah_, the quality of audacity for good or bad, are some of factors cited
by Dan and Saul as shapers of those cultural aspects in Israel.

[^idf]: Compulsory service to the Israeli Defense Forces apparently played a crucial role in shaping generations of leaders well-suited to thrive in the tech sector.
[^il]: You may not hear too much about those startups because they tend to get bought out before they show up on your radar. Remember [Mobileye to Tesla or Waze to Google][il-exit]?

It needs to be noted that Europe has claimed its share of startup wins such as
- Adyen (payment) :credit_card:
- Deliveroo (food delivery) :bento:
- Klarna (payment) :credit_card:
- Rovio (games) :video_game:
- Shazam (song detection and streaming) :musical_score: :iphone:
- Skype (videoconferencing) :video_camera: :phone:
- Skyscanner (travel, flight booking) :airplane:
- Spotify (streaming, audio) :musical_note: :headphones:
- Supercell (games) :video_game:
- Takeaway.com (food delivery) :bento:
- Zalando (retail) :dress: :necktie: :shoe: :jeans: :handbag:

but in all honesty the numbers of European tech startups founded and matured
(acquisition, IPO or just plain old going-steady) are obviously not nearly as
impressive in numbers in relation to the population if you were to contrast it
to Israel... or the US, to get back on topic. :wink:

Culture and access to capital, venture capital in particular, are important
factors to entrepreneurship anywhere. The differences in culture and capital
access may provide some clues as to why America performs differently to Europe
in the startup arena.

<div class="element note">
An interesting idea to entertain is that an ecosystem with smaller startups
instead of the behemoths that we witness hailing from the US comes with its own
set of benefits. Due to competition, such "smaller firms" would be obligated to
pay closer attention to the voice of their customer or user base, something
that becomes easier to ignore when one is "too large to avoid". Furthermore, such
ecosystems may provide users with more and perhaps better alternatives to
address the differing needs with more focus. At the same time, it follows that
this fragmentation may result to adverse cost effects that otherwise could be
mitigated through business growing to economies of scale. This, however; is a
topic for another post.
</div>

## Venture Capital

Europe doesn't have venture capital like it used to. During the Age of
Exploration, explorers ventured into the unknown with the financial backing of
the elite. During the Industrial Age, money seemed to find its way to the
machine builders and inventors which in turn helped Europe maintain its
relevance by establishing it as an industrial power. The Information Age has
produced some wins as previously mentioned but few to none of those wins
managed to capture their audiences as well as some of the popular American
names.

I've been through a few cohorts at accelerators and have witnessed peers
maneuver the fund-raise dance in Europe and in America to vastly different
results. In my experience, numerous teams that proposed ideas deemed
"nonfundable" in Europe have managed to raise funding in the US. Fortunately,
US founders still end up finding their way to Europe although generally not for
the funding climate but rather for things such as the higher quality of life at
a lower cost. :money_with_wings:

</div>

Slowly but surely, investors are catching on and this can be observed in the
growing sums of money invested in European ventures. [Crunchbase
reports][cb-vc] 17.7B USD being invested in EU startups in 2015 while they
tracked about twice as much, 36B USD, being invested in 2019.
Dealroom has [reported][dealroom] a steady growth of European venture capital
from 2019 through 2018 starting at 6.5B EUR and growing to exceed 21.2B EUR.
Statista provides data on the [number of investments][statista-num] and the
[sum of investments][statista-val] in Europe which also supports the notion
that the funding situation is improving.
In fact, an older 2017 [analysis by Pitchbook][pitchbook] emphasized that deal
size itself was increasing, allowing startups to do push further and get more
done per deal.
Assuming that each source honors consistent definitions for startups and
investments year-over-year, it seems evident that the influx of capital to
European startups has been ramping up. :moneybag:

At some point, one can only hope that easier access to capital will allow
founders to dare to take more chances to actually push whichever frontier
they've zeroed in on. Thriving startup ecosystems are a lot more than just
money though.

## Culture

With multiple countries, languages and distinct cultures, Europe is somewhat of
a challenging, culturally heterogeneous, sandbox in which to grow a startup. I
would go as far to argue that America, with all its differences between the two
coastlines, is arguably more homogeneous in a cultural sense than a similarly
sized chunk of Europe.

Even as a "nation-of-immigrants" that is subjected to so many cultural
influences, America has developed to shape some core cultural values that seem
to be commonly held by most.

Those observations aside, I would consider the
- tolerance for risk,
- bias towards big think,
- individualistic leanings and
- willingness or daringness to cooperate

as notable cultural factors that may provide some explanation as to why America
seems fertile ground for [Big Tech][bigtech][^bt] startups.

### Risk
In the parts of Western Europe that I've spent most time in, prudence is hailed
as a virtue. As a generalization one may note that the Dutch[^1] joke about
their Calvinistic tendencies and although I rip at the Dutch, this is a
tendency that I've experienced in multiple parts of the continent. While the
European is busy conducting cost-benefit analysis, an American somewhere has
already dispatched capital and put folks to work to find a solution.

I can already imagine some Europeans cringe at the idea of just venturing into
the unknown but if new functional concepts arise from experimentation, it follows
to assume that the every-trying American is set to win at some point.
This idea doesn't quite gel with the flavor of risk-aversion commonly served in
Europe although cues are being taken from Silicon Valley and other startup
havens in order to develop a tolerance for experimentation and "failure".

Notably this risk-aversion is not only a challenge among the investment climate
but arguable also in the labor market where it may be challenging to entice
folks with the promise of shares in the risk and rewards. I often wonder if the
presence of our safety nets have some role to play in this, or perhaps we
designed those safety nets because we are so risk-averse? :thinking: One could
argue that the presence of safety nets should simplify or even encourage the
taking of risk given the comfort of knowing that on can only fall so far, but that
again could be a completely separate post.

</div>

I would assume that America's relationship to risk is shaped by it being a
nation of immigrants where nearly everyone has been brought up with the
awareness of a nearby history of venturing into the unknown to escape horror or
to pursue happiness. The authors of [Start-up Nation][sn] also related this
spirit to Israel's immigrants. In Europe, my immigrant peers seem to care less
about failing or hitting rock bottom and thus seem more comfortable taking
certain risks. Of course there are some nuances. Many of those immigrant often
struggle to secure the needed initial funding which they, considering
circumstances, can't source from the famous goto initial funding parties
colloquially referred to as ["family and friends"][fandf]. Being a
2nd-generation immigrant to the Netherlands, spending my formative years in
Suriname, I have also sort of developed a risk-averseness that
[Leni][leni][^leni] and I often hold up to the mirror in laughter. She
considers much of what I do far too risky while I often think she is playing
things too safe. We brush off our somewhat culturally-defined character traits
on her being very German in her efforts to seek security and me just being a
flexible volatility-conditioned Surinamese Dutchman.

### Big Think
Somehow I tend to get the sense that Americans, in general, think a bit bigger
than their European peers. I often consider this a feature or component of
American culture that may play a role in explaining the differences in the
types of startups that both ecosystems produce. It took Americans to propose a
concept for a car that, to an European, effectively feels like a house on
wheels. It is in America where one finds portions that are over-dimensioned for
the average-sized human stomach such as the "Big Gulp" and other "Supersized"
food items. Big is almost synonymous with America and America has not just
applied this to object but equally enthusiastically to ideas as well.
Furthermore, reasoning about serving a quarter billion people is different in
The United States as opposed to Europe. This exercise in Europe would require
consideration for internationalization (languages, notation systems, etc.),
cultural differences and regulatory aspects in order to achieve a similar
scale, thus presenting another challenge for European startups that may not
always be trivial to resolve.

### Individualism and Collectivism
America and Europe seem to exhibit different leanings on the
individualism-to-collectivism spectrum. Europeans tend to recognize the central
role that collectivism seems to play in some Asian societies and simultaneously
often seem gloss over the notion that "the self" fills a seemingly more subdued
role in Europe as opposed to the US. Europe's political history may have
something to do with its predominantly collectivist leanings but that topic is
definitely out of scope for this post[^2]. For now, types such as Steve Jobs,
Bill Gates and Elon Musk have become somewhat of an American phenomenon. Even
some of Europe's notable tech leaders, such as [Linus Torvalds][linus] (creator
of Linux, the operating system that runs the web :smirk:) and [Guido van
Rossum][guido] (creator of Python, a language that facilitates rapid software
development and machine learning), have relocated to the United States.
Supposedly, a culture so eager to celebrate individualism and support such
dreamers in a manner, will enable many more of such visionaries to do what
others deem "crazy". Meanwhile, Europe's different mindset could give birth to
ventures of a considerably different nature. Since funds are more readily
streaming into the European startup sector, I'm already looking forward to
witness how other models, such as cooperative models for example, will shape
the European startup scene.

[linus]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds
[guido]: https://gvanrossum.github.io/
[^2]: Europe has arguably experimented with collectivist political ideology more than America has.

### Collaboration
For its individualistic-leanings, the American startup scene has managed to
prove rich with collaboration. Founders will readily find themselves good
mentors to help their businesses forward, especially around the Silicon Valley
region, which [Quartz][qz] referred to as the "Pay-it-forward" mentality. [Leon
Pals][leonpals] reminded me of Steve Jobs walking away with some Xerox
technologies which exemplifies that spirit of collaboration. Collaboration
wasn't always amicable, however; and it wasn't rare for collaborators to become
competitors just like Steve Jobs' collaboration with Bill Gates eventually
evolved into a passioned battle between opponents. Over time, many companies
have found themselves relocating to the west coast in order to benefit from the
multitude of ideas, capital and willingness to collaborate. The tension that
may have stemmed from collaborations that evolved into rivalries may have been
a catalyst in keeping Silicon Valley tech firms on edge.

## Conclusion

Culture and capital may be notable factors in explaining why Europe hasn't been
able to produce tech ventures at the scale observed in the US. The changing
investment climate, however; may yet result to more changes on this front.
Although I would expect the cultural factors to remain a challenge for a while
they simultaneously present an opportunity for things to be done differently.

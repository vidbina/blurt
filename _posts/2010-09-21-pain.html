The announcer and tour guide with whom I made entry into this world and the ultimate friend who will stand by my loved ones upon my return.<br /><br />It is the father who disciplined and teacher who kept me sharp. The mother that waked me, the general who drilled until my outer shell grew hard.<br /><br />The vessel that brought about redemption, that not even the gods could avoid.<br /><br />Coming to think of it... mathematically, it continually reoccurs as one of the resultant products of love. Another bright concept brewed up by the ultimate Genius up above.<br /><br />It is the phantom that we, after several millennium of language, still cannot properly describe, abstract enough to be used by manifold artists amongst us to thrive.<br /><br />Basically stated, it is pain that proves that I am still amongst the living.<br />And guess what... <br /><br />I've never been more alive!!!

<p>Every now and <strong>then</strong>, like just a second ago, I get a bit confused and mix a few words up. The English language just happened to have those pairs of unfortunate words that never really seem quite distinguishable from each other -- at least, that's what it seems like.</p>
<p>Then and than... A single letter a major difference. Then being used to refer to something in relation to a specific moment whereas than is typically used to express comparison.</p>
<p>Efficient or effective... To efficiently get something done has to do with the usage of available resources, effective often refers to the property of achieved a set goal with a higher rate of consistency. It might cost 100x more but miss 3 times as much it's true purpse.</p>
<p>Precise and accurate...</p>

title: When your NixOS store outgrows you...
description: |
  Limbo! Filled up the partition :floppy_disk: containing
  <code>/nix/store</code> to the brim.  y computer :computer: froze up and I'm
  at a conference. Need to grow some partitions to give NixOS :snowflake: some
  space. :free:

I'm running around on [TOA2017](https://toa.berlin) and I just did something stupid.
It all started with me being in the process of installing all of the tooling
necessary to deal with the Estonian digital bureaucracy from my NixOS :snowflake:
machine...

After noticing that I could build chrome with WideVine support, which I needed
anyways for Netflix :unamused: I managed to trigger the most rigorous build on
my nix setup to date. DAMN.

Apparently, WideVine support on Nix requires a lot of shit to be pulled and
compiled from scratch. So much so that a 40 gig partition with about 20
percent of free space will not suffice to pull you through the experience.

So what happens when NixOS runs on a box without any storage left on the
`/` partition? It chokes :angry:. Getting past the display manager has been
one of my failings over the past hours. Good thing that I always walk with
a bootable NixOS stick for exactly these occassions.

Fortunately enough, I had anticipated the potential need to do something rather
rigorous to my machine, which prompted me to keep the user directory safely on
a seperate partition allowing me to change my OS without risking my files
:wink:.

Let's run through the circus :snowflake:

The instructions on the NixOS page are pretty straightforward when it comes
to partitioning. I will not provide any real help here since gparted makes
creating, removing and modifying partitions a breeze.

```
nix-shell -p gparted
gparted
```

<div class="element note">
In case you are out of luck in enlarging the existing partition due to lack of
a consecutive partition, you could consider stitching two partitions together
in LVM and using them as a larger logical volume, but that is beyond the scope
of this little note-to-self.
</div>

It's my LVM and LUKS setup that required a bit more thought. I had formerly
created a volume group with two logical volumes -- a 40 gig btrfs volume and
a 10 gig swap volume. With both volumes mounted into the system I had to

 - reconfigure Nix to boot without the swap volume
 - reboot to system such that the swap volume is not utilised
 - remove the swap volume
 - resize the root volume to fill the entire drive
 - resize the btrfs partition to utilize the full size of the volume

## TL;DR

So Tech Open Air has been pretty cool so far, I've
 - played around with tools for building chatbots (wasn't really impressive, anyways I learned
 something there)
 - witnessed a classical mini concert mixed with a perfume experience that was quite meditative,
 - learned about another innovation in mobility that rises from inventive minds in Karlsruhe
 - got some inside scoop and lessons from a bunch of cool people including
   - [Gadi from
NewDealDesign](https://newdealdesign.com/studio) (one of the bright minds behind Fitbit),
   - [Ryan from Floodgate Fund](http://floodgate.com/ryan-walsh/) (one of the bright minds
   behind Beats by Dre),
   - a couple of professors working on some cool interactive work-out setups backed by the
   Max-Planck Institute and
   - a plethora of AI-heads working on a number of different problems.

Meanwhile I'm dealing with my little machine fuck-up :rage:

Basically /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix contains a listing of the disk
configuration that is currently in effect. Since I had another swap partition taking up
the space that I needed to expand my logical volume to accomodate my growing needs, I
I needed to remove the line referencing the device that bears the uuid to the LVM mapping
for my swap drive in order to avoid mounting it at boot :wink:.

In my case `realpath /dev/disk/by-uuid/UUID_OF_SWAP_B` pointed to `/dev/dm-N`
which is the path for a mapped device so out it went.


```
swapDevices = [
  { device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/UUID_OF SWAP_A"; }
  # { device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/UUID_OF_SWAP_B"; }
];
```

After a reboot, I was able to remove the swap partition with

```
sudo lvremove /dev/vg/swap
```

and subsequently extend the logical volume using

```
sudo lvextend -l 100%FREE /dev/vg/root
```

That is all :wink: and all done within a few minutes.

After that I proceeded to `nixos-rebuild test`. The `google-chrome` package with
WideVine is still building. A full day of occassionally plugging in to build has
not been enough :hourglass_flowing_sand:.

It's about time to leave the premises. Something with a raft is next :rowboat: :metal:.

So I'll `sudo systemctl hibernate` and continue this busy work later... Well busy-work
for the machine... I basically just read papers, chat with cool people including my
Startupbus family and of course... chill :grin:

<div class="element note">
The [Nix manual](https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/index.html#sec-nix-gc) mentions
the use of the `nix-store --optimise` command which, also in my case cleaned up
20 gigs of 50 so yeah... do yourself a favor. :wink:
</div>

## Learnings

 - install your home directory to a seperate partition... you'll be glad you did someday
 - do encrypt your :shit: (just because...)
 - use LVM... It's convenient to be able to stitch LV's together if you ever run out of space :wink:

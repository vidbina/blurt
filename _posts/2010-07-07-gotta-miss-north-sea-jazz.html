<a href="http://kingvidbina.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/nsj2010zat.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-31 alignleft" title="nsj2010zat" src="http://kingvidbina.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/nsj2010zat.png" alt="" width="378" height="300" /></a>I'm checking the line-up... imagining what it would've been like to actually be able to go but yeah... i choose to study... kind of dropped working besides that which leaves me with a empty wallets. No NSJ for me I guess *sights*. DAMN!!!

If I could go... i would've definitely checked it out. I mean, Herbie, Earth Wind and Fire, R. Bona, Stevie Wonder and Chick Corea are here. Rotterdam Ahoy is going to be blazing the next couple of days... I'm just going to have to do with youtube vids. :$ buhbye...

Coming to think of it: This schoolthing better pay off *sights*

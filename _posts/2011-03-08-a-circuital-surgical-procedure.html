<p>The most important machine in my room stopped ticking not too long ago. My computer has practically reclined into its demise as the meticulously engineered accumulation of various dielectrics, copper, gold, silicon and plastics refuses to remain powered on for times exceeding the length of thirty minutes.</p>
<p>"Worthless!", you may say. Maybe time for a new box, maybe time for this box to get acquianted with the dump.</p>
<p>Well... I disagree. A quick glance inside the box revealed a few possible culprits. Dried up solder paste, as a former colleague of mine suggested, proved to be one if them. A few centimers removed from the processor I spied, with my little eyes, a few caps who have been through something probably best described as a miniature volcanic eruption. Must have been hectic down there.</p>

<p>I reckon it might be time to excavate the board from the dust, grab a duster and start heating my soldering gun.</p>
<p>Poor cores have most likely been exposed to unbearable temperatures. I just hope they still work.</p>

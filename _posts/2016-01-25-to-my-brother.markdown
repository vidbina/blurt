description: I lost my brother in a nightmare then woke up to a world where he was alive as ever. I just felt I needed to share a few things with my younger brother, a remarkable homosapien specimen.

Distraught and drenched in sweat -- it is the second time I woke to a
nightmarish dream.

It was due to a landing gear failure that the aircraft with my brother on board
perished. I brushed it off as a dream, but my entire day so far has been really
weird. Maybe not just because of the dream because the weather in Berlin really
sucks at the moment, but I can surely attest that this episode somewhat threw
me off my productive streak.

Since, I'm no good at coming up with intelligent solutions to the engineering
problems in front of me; I've decided to jot down a few musings of my brain to
get over this weird episode. Hopefully, I'll be able to carry on with my
engineering puzzles after writing this "Dear Diary"-type entry, not sure if this
will work as an outlet so I'll find out soon enough.

I've told the young feller plenty of times that he's a remarkable element in my
life, but I realize that I probably don't spend enough time mentioning that to
the people that matter to me. Once more... Jonathan, I'm so darn grateful I
know you. I should have you a trophy :trophy: to emphasize it.

I admire your creativity, especially in terms of comedy, and I feel that your
absence would certainly create a void in my life in terms of comic relief. I
often find myself chuckling whenever I reminisce about the things you've said,
the stunts you've pulled or the weird episodes we've shared.

Remember how we use to cart you around in a wheelbarrow as youngsters? We were
all very young and very stupid and I remember that you often fell out of that
wheelbarrow unto the concrete floor with Annie and I desperately trying to
console you. We just did it because we didn't want pops and moms to find our
what we were doing to you... Yeah, little assholes, right?!? You certainly took
a few for the team there, little soldier and I commend you on your bravery or
stupidity; however you want to see it. I recall you having a bald spot at the
back of your head because of all the falls you took to that spot -- those
inflicted by your loving siblings during our stunts and those inflicted by
yourself while pulling all those ridiculous stunts which made it possible for
you to be the most acrobatic member of the family at the moment.

Talking about acrobatics... I admire your agility and strength. I can't do half
the things you manage to pull. Probably because I spend too much time behind my
computer as a youngster while you were out in the backyard attempting back
flips and falling more times than I can imagine me breaking computers. I tried
the back flip on a trampoline not too long ago and you laugh at me to this
day for that weak attempt... yeah, I'm nowhere near as acrobatic as you are. I
also remember inviting you to a capoeira class and finding you gasping for air
in the middle of the session. Nice for me that I still beat your ass in some
areas... gheghe.

I cherish the memory of that one time we almost killed each other in a playful
wrestling episode about a year ago. It was a great way of just being rowdy,
probably not too wise to repeat that too often (especially not as we gradually
age) but now, in our prime, such episodes really make our brotherhood even more
memorable.

I remember returning home to Suriname about a year ago and greeted by you
through a little wrestling skirmish on the floor in the kitchen, while our
parents and younger sister, watched. Screw hugs and handshakes... you felt that
the only way to properly welcome me was through a display of uncensored primate
strength. That was after we had not seen each other in the flesh for about
what?!? Three years?!? I pegged you down in a hold and you've been aching to
get back at me ever since. Well.. You pretty much did the last time back at
Annie's place in Rotterdam. You had me in a choke hold so proficiently executed
that I remember it to this day. I had to tap out or get my neck snapped off.
You're pretty f:collision:ing strong.

I enjoy chatting with you about matters pertaining to live and it's intricacies.
Whether it is about our careers, spirituality, politics, economics, family,
comedy or any topic; I'm always delighted to have exchanges with you. You
don't always have sensible answers[^1] in my perspective, but I love that you
have opinions. Opinions that sometimes trigger me to venture into
challenging avenues of thought.

[^1]: I must admit that I sometimes don't even find my answers sensible, so let's both take it personally :wink:.

It's so clich√©, but I think you couldn't have done any better in the younger
brother department -- for me, you're just the right bit of crazy, the right bit
of funny, the right bit of physically challenging... the right bit of
everything. Yeah, I'll say it... you're the perfect younger brother to me.

You're an annoying little brat and I love the fact that you always try to get
back at me.

And I'm so f:bomb:ing glad it was just a nightmare! Can't wait to punch you in the
chest again, just to celebrate the fact you're alive as ever! Love ya and stay
alive, Warrior Brother; which rhymes which Mario Brother[^mario] so here is
a matching gif with that... :stuck_out_tongue:

[^mario]: Would you be Mario or Luigi in that case?

I just called my brother who's 8050 kilometers away... cooking dinner with
pops.

Look at that...

_Life is good, life is good, no matter what... life is good_ as Nas said in
_Cherry Wine_.

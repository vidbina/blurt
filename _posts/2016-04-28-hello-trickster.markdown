The people's _favorite_ companies do this all the time. The people pay taxes
like there is no tomorrow while the companies sell them overpriced services or
goods and hardly pay any taxes on their royal markups. Hurrah capitalism[^capitalism]!
Meanwhile these companies get subsidized and bailed out with whatever bit
of money was collected in the tax pot; that very same tax pot that the
companies actively tried to keep their money from.

[^capitalism]: I'm a fan of the mix of capitalist and social ideals that we serve in the Netherlands. It strikes me as a healthy balance of two systems that both offer sufficient pros and cons. However, I attribute the tax evasion problem to the capitalistic ideals that some swear by which seem to be focused on profit, whatever that may mean. This attribution may be wrong, but it's just a product of my limited view and understanding of the world and its driving factors.

They <span class="strike">fooled</span> tricked us again.

Lately we've been talking about the Panama Papers, like the phenomenon is
anything new. :unamused:

The thing that bugs me out is how we talk about corruption and seemingly
unethical behavior in _developing_ countries (like the one where I'm from).
In these countries the people seem to have the bravado to be
somewhat transparent about their dealings, whether you'd call their dealings
corrupt or not. Perhaps the lack of resources to aid in being more deceptive
and less elaborate legal/taxation frameworks to provide sufficient
incentive for large scale deception, has better transparency as a side effect.

Point is: Seemingly corrupt or unethical dealings spread the gamut in terms of
class.

<div class="element note">
I believe corruption may be the wrong word. Maybe they're just heartlessly
clever -- the tricksters of modern society.

I grew up on tales of [Anansi][anansi] who was always praised as the
wise one, despite of once tricking his own children into giving him
significant portions of their food. If a father does that nowadays, the
neighbors would probably call social security services to take control; social
security being another one of the nonsolutions to our problems but
alas, I digress. In The Netherlands I've heard a tale or
two about [Reinaard de Vos][reynard], a cunning fox and undiscriminating
trickster. In the United States I recall Jerry often being the triumphant one,
even when he was obviously at fault for provoking Tom. Sometimes Tom just
didn't deserve that treatment.

Sometimes we just reward trickery with gifts or praise, I guess. :gift:
</div>

Whatever we do in the _developed_ parts of the world is deceptive, sly and
probably more dangerous because many citizens of _developed_ countries
themselves seem to have a lot to say about the sad state of corruption in the
_developing_ world while completely oblivious to the fecal matter brewing in
their own homes :home:.

New legislation is constantly forced down our throats
(although we, muggles, are not always aware of it), new treaties are constantly
closed (I wonder if TTIP will happen :sweat:), the regulating commissions serve
the industries they regulate... Since we wear suits, push laws and perform
proceeding after proceeding it's all legit? The people hardly know what's
happening anymore because there's always something more _entertaining_ to
discuss. Our tricksters are just that damn clever!

The following episode of [Tegenlight (Backlight in Dutch)][tegenlicht] is
rather old, but in light of the recent fuss about the Panama Papers I felt it
served as a good tool to aid in putting things into perspective. I know I'm
ranting about this, but I guess a rant or two a year is permitted, right?!?
:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Just remember... trickery is everywhere and there is no better flavor of it.
It all stinks just as much in the _developing_ world as it does in the
_developed_ world, whatever the hell that distinction really means[^a].

Sometimes the low play is the smart play. What if more of us would play that
game? Move money to offshore accounts, park intellectual property in the
Netherlands where it's taxed a bit lower, take advantage of convenient
constructs wherever it leads to a economic benefit. In a globalizing world, it
shouldn't make too much heads turn if you shuffle some money around, right?!?
The big dogs do it because apparently it makes sense. But if you do, however;
play the game with dignity. Don't evade taxes in The United States and then
rely on subsidies and other tax-facilitated benefits from the same piggy bank
that you shorted. That's seems dishonorable.

But... :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: what am I even talking about? It's money!
:moneybag: We will not think of the common good :sunglasses:... or will we?

[^a]: I've been to plenty of _developed_ countries and portions of such countries still remind me of whatever some would have labeled _developing_. It's an awful distinction, but I do use it because we are somewhat familiar with that backwards pattern. A pattern I help to uphold because I'd rather say _developing_ or _developed_ than _first-world_, _second-world_ or _third-world_. Yeah... shame on me. :disappointed_relieved:

If this is how things are done nowadays, you should at least enjoy some
convenient tax rates, right?!? Get your kids in a good school, retire in
comfort, support the organizations you care about... I bet you could put some
extra money to good use.

Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich on a Tropical Island it is, then. Cheers!

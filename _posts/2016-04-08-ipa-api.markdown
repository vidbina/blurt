  The goons in Amsterdam are having a IPA & API's meetup. I couldn't help but
  think about them once I saw a well-stocked IPA aisle at the Deli.

So a few fellas and gals are having a meetup in Amsterdam in a few minutes
:hourglass_flowing_sand:, a few days ago I ran into a IPA :beers: aisle at the
Deli, API and IPA are palindromes to each other, a few minutes ago I thought
about useless API's in the shower :shower:... guess what, it's friday and I'm
just connecting the dots here in a useless expenditure of time.

## Put Beer into the fridge

    PUT /brews

Put some beer into the fridge first.

You could drop crates into the fridge but that really doesn't make too much
sense unless you have a walk-in fridge.

```json
{
  "object": "crate",
  "content": []
}
```

You can also drop six-packs in the fridge... I'm just saying :smirk:.

```json
{
  "object": "six-pack",
  "content": []
}
```

Just put single [bottles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_bottle) into the
fridge if you take this seriously. You'll get more packed in there.

```json
{
  "object": "bottle",
  "volume": "300",
  "brand": "Backyard Brew",
  "type": "IPA",
  "state": "sealed",
  "content": "300"
}
```

The volume and content are expressed in milliliters. SI units rule! :metal:

Perhaps you're more into the canned variant. Everything is possible.

```json
{
  "object": "can",
  "volume": "330",
  "brand": "BeerPongKong",
  "type": "Pale Lager",
  "state": "sealed",
  "content": "330"
}
```

## Make inventory

    GET /brews

Figure out what there is in the fridge. Of course that liquid is best served
cold :snowflake:.

Perhaps you want to know which IPA's you have stocked up on, then just provide
the following data with the `GET` request.

```json
{
  "type": "IPA",
  "state": "sealed"
}
```

Perhaps you need something specific... like for example something of a certain
brand? Then again, send data with the `GET` request.

```json
{
  "brand": "BeerPongKong"
}
```

The result should look something like this:

```json
[
  {
    "uuid": "something-something-something-darkside",
    "object": "bottle",
    "etc": "etc"
  },
  {
    "uuid": "another-something-something-darkside",
    "object": "bottle",
    "etc": "etc"
  }
]
```


## Get something to quench that thirst

    GRAB /brews/random

Surprise yourself. Just have a cold one. A random brew that will hopefully
titillate the senses.

Be social about it, get some for your friends too.

## Drink

    GULP /brews/:uuid

Take a sip of that liquid delight in you hands at the moment. You can also run
around the room and take sips of everyone's beer to everyone's dismay and
every warm unfinished one on the tables. Not saying it's good for you, but it's
possible.

<div class="element note">
NOTE: Grabbed beers don't show up in the fridge anymore. So `GET /brews` will
not display the grabbed beers, however; you could still take a gulp of any
grabbed beer provided that there is something in it.
</div>

:shit: I have to get to work...

    DELETE /brews/:uuid

:recycle:d

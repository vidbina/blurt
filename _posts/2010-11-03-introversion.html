Wow... just did a little research on introversion and ended up staring into a mirror.

source: <a title="Wikipedia Introversion" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Introversion">Wikipedia: Introversion</a>

Introversion is "the state of or tendency toward being wholly or predominantly concerned with and interested in one's own mental life".[3] Introverts are people whose energy tends to expand through reflection and dwindle during interaction.[4] Introverts tend to be more reserved and less outspoken in large groups. They often take pleasure in solitary activities such as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reading</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">writing</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">music</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">drawing</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">tinkering</span>, playing video games, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">watching movies and plays</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">using computers</span>, along with some more reserved outdoor activities such as fishing. In fact, <strong>social networking sites have been a thriving home for introverts in the 21st century, where introverts are free from the formalities of social conduct and may become more comfortable blogging about personal feelings they would not otherwise disclose</strong>. The archetypal artist, writer, sculptor, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">engineer</span>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">composer</span>, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">inventor </span>are all highly introverted. An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people, though he or she may enjoy interactions with close friends. Trust is usually an issue of significance: a virtue of utmost importance to an introvert choosing a worthy companion. They prefer to concentrate on a single activity at a time and like to observe situations before they participate, especially observed in developing children and adolescents.[5] Introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation from social gatherings and engagement. <strong>They are more analytical before speaking</strong>.[6]
Introversion is not the same as shyness or the social outcast. <strong>Introverts choose solitary over social activities by preference</strong>, whereas shy people (who may be extraverts at heart) avoid social encounters out of fear[7] and whereas the social outcast faces solitude, but not by choice.

It's almost like reading a section about myself :-o.

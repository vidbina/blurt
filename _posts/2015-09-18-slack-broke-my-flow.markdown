description: "Just a rant about flow, task-switching and the methods I employ
to protect my flow at the office all instigated by another episode of Slack
alerting me out of my flow."

I'm getting stuff done again. Concocting possible next steps to be able to
present a well thought-through battleplan to the team. Yes, I'm awaiting that
moment the metrics demonstrate that we are set to move forward; that moment
when we have discovered the wave we are to ride :surfer:. Suddenly I'm jolted
out of the zone by this one sound that I have come to dislike intensely :rage:.
Crap :shit:, that's what you get for forgetting to kill Slack before getting
started!

Generally I start my sessions by setting my phones to the silent mode (the one
that doesn't even vibrate), turning on the "Do Not Disturb" mode on my laptop
and occasionally wearing my headphones just to keep possible smalltalk hungry
fellows at bay.

What we all seek is that flow. It takes energy to get into the flow and
interrupting someone in flow should become something we try our best to steer
clear of. Once a interrupt occurs task switching often follows and for many of
us, returning to whatever it was we were doing before can often cost a
significant deal of effort after such a interruption.

Task switching is hard and humans don't shine at performing this trick (neither
do computers by the way[^1]). The
[great Joel Spolsky][joel] wrote about it multiple times (read
[_Human Task Switches Considered Harmful_][joel-task-switching],
[_Where do These People Get Their (Unoriginal) Ideas?_][joel-in-the-zone] and
[The Multi-Tasking Myth][joel-multitasking-myth]) and a
[lot of brilliant researchers][ama-multitasking] have empirically studied the
costs of task switching. Task switching is not unrelated to interruptions and
everyone who has ever written code with a non coder nearby knows how
frustrating it is to lose a train of thought to hear about
[another oh-so-funny cat meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/search?q=cat).

[^1]: Multitasking in computing requires a context switch which is a rather expensive operation. Registers, stack pointers and program counters are modified as the context is altered for the one task to be properly suspended and another task to be initiated or resumed. Just running a single task is generally more efficient as there is no switching overhead. A processor with multiple cores isn't multitasking if every core is handling another task (it is in fact multiprocessing) and humans aren't multitasking if every member in the team is doing one thing at a time from start to finish. It's that simple and there is more to read on this matter by [the Crazy Programmer][multi].

Many startup spaces that I've visited don't seem to understand the damage
caused by pulling knowledge workers out of the zone. This post just covers a
few remedies I use to deal with that.

## Time-out

My fellow team members and I have an understanding. Whenever they ask for a
minute and I pick up the audible mumbling or gestures, I either redirect my
attention to them when I'm available or signal a time-out if I'm really close
to cracking a nut :chestnut:.

This allows me to get stuff done, while acknowledging their need to be heard
in a short while. Most of the people I have worked with understood this. It
just took me explaining my flow to get them to understand, but at the end of
the day no one wants to be responsible for getting you out of that
_getting-things-done_ flow... just let them know :wink:.

Talk with your team members about the types of issues they can trouble you
with.

## Headphones

I must admit that I often have nothing playing in my headphones :headphones:,
because at some times music kills my focus (especially when I'm reading
papers[^emre]).

The cool thing about the headphones, however; is that most people seem to
understand that one is not to be bothered for small matters whenever the
headphone wall has to be broken.

[^emre]: Speaking about papers, I just stumbled upon [Emre Karagozler's](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mkaragoz/) work (whom I just learned about through the [Google Soli](https://www.google.com/atap/project-soli/) project). I read his [_Harnessing Capacitance for Inter-Robot Latching, Communication, and Power Transfer_](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~claytronics/papers/karagozler-msreport07.pdf) paper and would recommend it to anyone who tinkers with electronics. It's pretty remarkable material and just being aware of this method of latching modular robots is worthwhile.

## Noise

Whenever a workspace gets really noisy, I often crank up the
[white noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzjWIxXBs_s) which works well in
drowning out the noises of pingpong, the laughs of meme watching folk and the
funky beats of the one person who just has to play that through his Sonos.

</div>

In the spirit of _live and let live_ I don't bug Mr. S about his music,
heck sometimes his playlists are great. When I need to focus I'll turn up my
noise. Everybody happy :smile:.

## Kill Slack

Slack is a wonderful tool to communicate within teams, but until they introduce
a silencer I will have to kill it before I venture into my focus zone. Today I
forgot to do that and it's probably the fact that it really startled me that I
jumped on the rant bandwagon.

Since last year, some users have been begging for this feature.

Apparently we haven't begged loudly enough, so I'm giving it a try as well
:mega:. At some point they will have to make our day, right? Come on
people at Slack don't be slackers (couldn't resist using the demonym pun),
:shipit: ship it!


Time to get back to work...

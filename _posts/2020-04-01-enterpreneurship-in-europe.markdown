A friend and I have recently picked up the writing exercise of posing each
other questions to use as the basis of a series of posts. The question for this
post was formulated in Dutch[^question] which I'll roughly translate into the
following snippet hoping that Elward, the sender, will be graceful enough to
forgive me where I inadvertently loose any of his focal points in translation:

> We have observed that Europe has not proved as successful as the United
> Stated in producing the dominant tech companies. Amazon, Apple, Facebook,
> Google and Microsoft are all American firms. Considering you're experiences
> in the startup scene in The Netherlands and Germany as well as the
> internation startup scene beyond that, what would you attribute this
> phenomenon to. Which factors contribute to America's dominant position in
> startups and what are the differences between the startup ecosystems that
> allow for America to perform this exceptionally.

[^question]: Het ondernemers klimaat in Europa: We hebben gezien dat Europa niet zo succesvol is geweest als America in het produceren van de grote technologische bedrijven van de afgelopen decenia.  Kijk bijvoorbeeld naar Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft dat zijn allemaal Americaanse bedrijven. Jij hebt zowel in Nederland als Duitsland de start-up wereld van dichtbij meegemaakt en je hebt ook ervaring met de international start-up wereld. Wat zou jij zeggen dat 1 van de grote oorzaken is die hieraan ten grondslag ligt. Welke andere dingen liggen hieraan ten grondslag. Is er een groot verschil in het ondernemers klimaat van Nederland en Duitsland m.b.t. het bovenstaande?  

Mind you, I'm not an anthropologist, economist, historian, psychologist or
sociologist but merely an engineer with many opinions about topics I don't
possess sufficient depth in even though I am constantly reading into these
topics to "wisen up".  It is therefore important to note that my musings
represent opinions derived from anecdotes and whatever historical record I
happen to be aware of, both of which will likely lead me down the path to a
number of flawed conclusions but you may find a few points, at the very least
an engineer's perspective, that may be reasonably sensible to entertain :wink:.

## Venture Capital

Europe doesn't have venture capital like it used to. I've been through a few
cohorts at accelerators on the continent and have witnessed a bunch of my peers
maneuver the fundraise dance both in Europe and in America to vastly different
results. Arguably most startups aren't really doing anything adventurous to
pique the interest of venture capital, but after witnessing one of my mentors
face considerable challenges in sourcing funds close to home for the
development of intellectual property for widely applicable timing chips that
find their way into our smartphones, tables, computers -- effectively every
smart device these days -- it definitely made me wonder whether European
venture capital is on a holiday.

### When Europe definitely had it: Exploration

The period from the 15th century till the 17th century is commonly hailed as
the [**Age of Discovery**][ageofdiscovery] or **Age of Exploration** in which
European priorities shifted towards exploring what they considered foreign or
unknown lands in an effort to secure trade routes and access to sought after
resources for geo-political (even if _geo_ may have been at a different scale
than we know it now :wink:) and economic reasons.

This age of exploration was effectively made possible by **adventurers**, or
[**entrepreneurs**][entrepreneur-etymology] as we would start calling such
"types" in 18th century, who **ventured** out into the unknown in order to
pursue riches with their eclectic crews comprised of the vessel owners,
sailors, expedition administrative staff members, artisans and at times what
some may consider nut-jobs or degenerates.

[columbus-crew]: http://www.christopher-columbus.eu/ships-crew.htm

Vasco da Gama and Christopher Columbus are among the most commonly known of
such adventurers and the sponsors of their ventures, typically monarchs,
effectively became the first to provide _venture capital_ if you will.

### When Europe still had it: Industrialization

Arguably, the United States was still in its nascent stages during that
so-called Age of Exploration but towards the ending of the 18th century,
however; America found itself in a much better state to take part in the
industrial age, the rat race of the times.

During the [Industrial Age][industrial-age], venture capital reared its head
again albeit it in a slightly different form factor. Instead of dispatching
expeditions, capital was, among other things, dispatched to finance the
development of better machinery, the waging of intellectual property battles
with great furore, the construction of railroads and the surveying for precious
natural resources such as oil and gold.

England was more or less the cradle of industrialization, but one would be
remiss if they mentioned industrialization and Europe in a breath but managed
to avoid addressing the role of Germany in the movement considering that
Germany is more or less hailed as the pinnacle of modern European
industrialization.

Reunification of formerly quibbling states by Otto von Bismarck effectively
paved the way for Germany to take advantage of its abundance in resources and
opportunity. Protectionist measures, government support for industry and
artisanship, incentives towards technical education, the development of a
welfare system, the breathing room for a pragmatic insurance and banking sector
and considerable investments in infrastructure (rail and road), may have
contributed towards Germany stepping up in comparison to its nearest neighbor
at scale, across that proverbial "pond".

I would regard Bertha Benz, born Ringer, as one of the notable German venture
capitalist of that time. Stemming from nobility, she effectively fell for a
mechanically inclined regular-Joe who happened to operate a troubled business
with his partner. Bertha provided capital to allow Karl to buy out his partner
and focus on getting the company back on track. Understandably some may
consider Bertha more of an angel investor, but it must be noted that a pivot
from a sheet-metal working shop to a engine manufacturing operation is
considerable and risky enough to claim otherwise.

There are more of such tales of lovers, acquaintances and institutions across
the continent providing the breathing room for interesting ventures to take
root, but it also seems that European investors in general have grown
increasingly prudent in their allocation of capital to ventures. This, to the
extend that new (or "so new" that it is still colloquially classified as crazy)
ideas often find it challenging to take root in Europe on account of the
scarcity of capital while the same ideas seem to find fertile soil in America
more readily.

### When Europe took a step back: Information Age Startups

I often joke about this among my acquaintances and it seems that more
entrepreneurs tend to share the viewpoint that European investors are a
different creature to the American investor who seems to have internalized the
direct relationship between risk and reward so well that they seem more capable
of comfortably shrugging of that notion of taking risks -- "part of the game,"
an American investor seemingly thinks while they sign that check as long as
they have enough different plays in motion to manage their exposure. Europe may
have grown partial to financial security, social security and stability over
the years and it is hard to say if the trauma of recent European history
involving multiple wars and socio-economic experiments plays a role here.

Additionally, it is hard to overlook that American ventures have access to a
larger and more homogeneous domestic market than European ventures. A French
social-media startup, for example, can design a solution that thrives by
cleverly playing to French cultural nuances, including business sensibilities.
Upon attempting to reach a wider user-base, however; this startup will be
required to deal with the non-trivial challenges of addressing the cultural,
lingual and regulatory differences they will find themselves facing. Different
strokes for different folks, right?!? A business that relies on network effect
dynamics and would therefore need to obtain critical mass at some point, may
therefore be better off starting outside of the union where they can grow that
critical mass (such as China, India, the US) and only then set foot on the
European continent since acceptance is sometimes much easier when you're so big
that people see an obvious advantage in having you around.

Europe may be one continent, but it is a remarkably diverse amalgamation of
folks and as such a one-size-fits-all solution may be much harder to come by
for any company operating within the continent. Even if one were to agree that
the European Union is an interesting tool in providing a framework to reason
about some of the regulatory complexity, __one still needs to navigate the maze
of cultural nuances in order to make a business break out of its regional
sandbox__ to serve a much larger market. Quite frankly, investors have to
acknowledge that their investment is likelier to produce the next regional big
thing as opposed to than the _"next big thing"_ thus setting a glass ceiling to
cap that number that an investor may be willing to part with.

Europe has a good number of government grants that entrepreneurs can take
advantage of to advance their business though and this often against favorable
terms that make no requirement of relinquishing control of the company. The
application procedures are at times strenuous but venture capital wasn't
particularly known for being easy so perhaps this evens out. The numbers
involved are vastly different, but then again European salaries are
considerably lower to American salaries (sometimes at a factor 2 for tech
talent) so there are some options to get interesting ideas off the ground. The
real problem exists with high-tech ventures that have considerable start-up
costs. After all, platform companies can be built in garages or dorm-rooms, but
device development often requires facilities, tooling costs or material
purchases in bulk that are escorted by bills that are challenging to foot
with the funds of grant programs. In this case, you better have decent
connections to find yourself a large enough angel or a venture capital fund
that has the guts to help you along the way.

## Culture

On multiple occasions I have heard folks almost simplify the American ethos to
one-liners such as "Bigger is Better" and "Go Big or Go Home" emphasizing
America's fascination with scale. American songs are decorated with lines like
"I did it my way", "Me, Myself and I" and "All by myself" that provide a sense
of America's celebration of individualism. Sayings such as "Time is Money" may
emphasize the strong focus on the illustrious American buck. And with idioms
such as "if you got it, flaunt it" being as commonplace as they are, it becomes
so much more comfortable to maintain a unapologetic relationship to whatever it
is that you have -- especially wealth.

These perhaps seemingly insignificant elements of American culture propagate
nearly every stratum of society. Success is greatly celebrated, wins and
decorations are worn with pride and losing... well, it sucks but the good part
is that you can always try again because the pursuit of happiness doesn't end
with a loss and to be frank, by trying so much different things a single loss
is effectively just a drop in the bucket.

This is strongly contrasted against the Puritanical views that seem to have
shaped The Netherlands where success is fortunate but something that you keep
more to yourself in an attempt to display humility whereas losses, especially
bankruptcies, still seem like everlasting lesions of your failings to yourself
and society and undeniable testaments of one's lack of prudence and self
restraint or discipline. Luckily, the Dutch[^dutch] proudly wear their
Calvinistic tendencies as a badge of honor and don't shy away from using this
as ammunition when engaging in humorous self-ridicule which serves as an
effective coping mechanism at times.

I'm not suggesting that either of those cultural cherry-pickings are negative
or positive on their own but I am suggesting that they may contribute to
shaping interesting cultural paradigms in which different ideas may fare
with different rates of success.

[^dutch]: Just picking on the Dutch since I was born in The Netherlands and carry a Dutch passport, so if anything, I'm one of them too.


### Bigger is Better

America likes "big things" and it shows. American vehicles are effectively
apartments, American cities feel massive, and not just because they liked
themselves some high-rises, and an American "Big Gulp" is an unconquerable
challenge for the stomach and bladder dimensioned to European portions. Maybe,
just maybe, this love for the "humongous" speaks to the imaginations enough for
Americans to want to engage on those bold quests at great costs.

It follows, however; that bigger adventures tend to correlate to bigger
catastrophes when shit hits the fan and therefore it I often find it
counterintuitive that, for a people so exposed when a plan were to fail,
Americans seem more willing to enter the warpath towards some goal in
comparison to Europeans with their safety nets. Seems that anything apparently
logical may be construed as illogical when approached from a slightly different
perspective after all. You can theorize that safety nets may render folks
complacent although you can also argue that safety nets could provide folks the
security to try new things. You can argue that the prospect of financial ruin
upon failure keeps one awake and on their toes in a country where everything is
controlled by the buck but one could also equally argue that this friction
could provide folks an incentive to optimize for stability and safety.

As mentioned when discussing the cultural diversity of Europe in the previous
chapter, when concerning oneself with the scale question, it is worth
considering that any 5 Americans working on a solution effectively look at a
much larger pool of relatively highly-productive people to consider as their
domestic market as opposed to a European team of the same size. The American
fascination for scale is perhaps in part related to the sheer scale of the
nation in geographic size, population and, perhaps more interestingly, economic
productivity. A US platform startup with access to a 300M+ person audience off
the cuff, will talk a different numbers game as opposed to a startup offering
the same solution in The Netherlands with a roughly 17½M person audience with
the potential of another 80M folks in Germany if they successfully pull of
internationalizing (simply read: translate), complying to the differing
regulations and then addressing nuances that the founding team may possibly not
even properly understand.


### Individualism and Collectivism

It is curious how many Europeans seems to be aware of the central role that
collectivism plays in some Asian societies and simultaneously gloss over how
collectivist European societies seem in comparison to American society as a
whole. The self seems to fill a different, more subdued, role in European
societies than it seems to do in the United States.

Types such as Steve Jobs and Elon Musk have become an American phenomenon; a
visionary with notable quirks and dysfunctions leading hordes of bright folks
towards a single-minded goal in a winner-takes-all game. The fertile ground
found wherever individualism is so celebrated will breed many more of such
visionaries to the benefit of many although it seems fair to expect that cult
of personality and winner-takes-all setups will facilitate its share of frauds,
scandals and arguably detrimental wealth shifts along the way as well.

Surely, we can achieve innovation without such cult-like figures, one may think
and this is where I feel that our record testifies to the contrary. Harari so
discusses how storytelling serves as an organizational tools to facilitate
collaboration in larger groups -- national identity, technology vision, social
justice and religion all serve as great tools to that effect. In most cases
these causes need lead characters, even if only to provide some coherent vision
of where to go. Engineers may be familiar with the jokes about the failures of
design by consensus -- we simply don't always design better solutions by
allowing everyone to pitch in. In fact, I would argue that the iPhone would
have been a considerably less impressive device if the vision for the product
weren't defined by some eccentric tech artist. Wherever you find yourself on
the individualism-to-collectivism spectrum, we may have to acknowledge that
there are some systems that are best designed by a collectivist mindset while
there are others best designed by allowing some individual to let their
imaginations run wild.

Maybe Europe doesn't produce as many outlier startups as the US, but Europe's
somewhat collectivist leanings may be one of the things to attribute for
institutions that seem to prioritize human wellbeing quite pleasantly in
comparison. The ventures that will stem from such a system may exhibit
different characteristics to those shared by American top ventures and maybe
that's okay. Some of Europe's companies will be smaller in size and in market
segment ownership, but that possibly simplifies regulation and oversight which
may serve to protect the populous better over the long-term.

<!--
There seem to be
things that demand
smaller groups or single-mindedness to thrive.

Deification of "self-made"-ness is another aspect that nicely ties into the
individualism point that becomes difficult to overlook. Perhaps, Europe's
different relationship with immigration may play a part here. Meanwhile in
America, everyone has started from the bottom of some barrel in order to
complete the rite of passage to becoming a self-made individual. How many
stories about immigrants to the land of opportunity must one still hear that
include some line to the effect of having but a dollar to one's name or even
better, a sum denominated in pennies to emphasize how low one set off at the
start of their journey?  Even America's current President, who has thus far
never really known poor or middle-class circumstances, has more or less made
the "started from the bottom" claim when emphasizing how "small" that loan from
his father was.

Tech startups as we currently known them are fast, innovative and agile enough
to swiftly dominate large swathes or their market segments. A celebration of
individualism

### Winner takes all

The acceptance of losses as a part of growth is a concept that Europe is
starting to catch on to but one that America seems to have mastered over the
years. Failing your company to the point of bankruptcy will still produce a
battle scar that Europe will not allow you to forget too easily, but at least
we're starting to understand that one does not get the gains from exploration
without accepting that it requires some folks heading into wrong directions and
subsequently failing. Just make sure you have enough folks heading into vastly
different directions to maximize your chances of striking the proverbial gold
or oil.
-->

## In closing...

The world can only have a handful of winners when we engage in winner-takes-all
plays and, if it happened to be a point on our agenda, arguably the wealth
generated by such winners seems to do little towards resolving the increasing
wealth disparity problem.

What I personally tend to find more interesting is the larger number of smaller
sized enterprises that can not afford to disrespect their user base and are
naturally forced to compete or collaborate more effectively in order to thrive
and stick around. Surely, such enterprises would lack the advantages of
economics at scale but if we aren't seriously questioning what the hell we have
created by allowing some tech companies to grow unrestricted, we may have
bigger problems on our hands before we know it -- yesterday. It is already
interesting to observe governments attempting to figure out what oversight and
regulations should look like to keep companies such as Facebook in line but one
can argue that companies with coffers the size of national budgets, with the
outreach comparable to several of the largest broadcasting networks of the
world in aggregate and possibly with some control over critical infrastructure
world-wide are only "controllable" in our imaginations i.e.: not really.

<!--
Winner-take-all schemes are conducive to monopoly creation which provides a
central point of attack for exploitation. Furthermore, they are simply too
complex for individuals to effectively reason about let alone regulate. From an
evolutionary perspective, we should perhaps go back to focussing on diversity
by sending different parties into vastly different directions in order to find
more innovative solutions to our problems.
-->

We probably won't breed many unicorns in Europe and I haven't been convinced
yet that Europe would be missing out if that were to be the case. There needs
to be room for smaller ventures lead by visionaries, larger corporates that are
naturally a bit slower, collective-owned enterprises and other structures to
join the stage and cater to the different needs in the market. Maybe these
other players may, by their design, face constraints that drive them to operate
in a manner that is less exploitative in order to remain in business. I
wouldn't consider that a big problem but then again... I'm just an engineer.

### 

I served a startup around the beginning of 2018 which brought me to the valley
and New York on several occasions. My impression of the organization was that
it was tremendously disorganised and I mean disorganized to the extent that
most of my fellow European founders would consider it a matter of gross
negligence. Plans shifted by the minute, communications were often unclear, the
chain of command was apparently defective or crucial links were missing and
everything just felt as if it existed in a state of utmost entropy at all
times. The sharing of my observation was generally received with a "well you
don't quite get it, this is how we roll in the US" or some variation thereof.

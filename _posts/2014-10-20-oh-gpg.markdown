To encrypt and decrypt my secret messages on my box I use GPG. This post is
hopefully going to jog the memory of senile future me (or just future me on a
day on which I happen to be hammered and need to perform this trick). Perhaps
there is something here that may be of any use to other folks as well 
:beer:.

## Encrypt it

In order to lock up a certain piece of information we can simply pipe it into
the `gpg` tool and instruct it how to encrypt it and where to store the 
ciphertext. To get started a file is created with the following shell command
that contains the text `launch codes` :rocket:.

{% highlight sh %}
echo "launch codes" > code.in.txt
{% endhighlight %}

The following command basically encrypts the string in the message file and
stores the ciphertext into the file `cipher.gpg`. The recipient 
`vid@bina.me` has been specified in order to instruct whom is to be able 
to decrypt the ciphertext. For the encrypted launch codes the given recipient
will be the only person who needs to know so&hellip; yeah&hellip; secrets
should be encrypted not just `chown`ed :closed_lock_with_key:.

{% highlight sh %}
cat code.in.txt | gpg -e -r vid@bina.me -o cipher.gpg
{% endhighlight %}

## Decrypt it

Now that the ciphertext is generated one may decrypt it with `gpg` as well.
{% highlight sh %}
gpg -d cipher.pgp > code.out.txt
{% endhighlight %}

## The Agent
Sometimes one may fire up an application that may need to make multiple calls
to encrypted resources. Decrypting all the data every time would present a most
annoying passphrase prompt every darn time.

<div class="element img">
  <img src="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/vid.bina.me/img/screenshots/gpgagent-mutt.png" alt="GPGagent popping up to decrypt a password needed by Mutt" />
</div>

The agent allows you to enter the passphrase once within a session and will
remember and handle the passphrase dance for as long as the passphrase happens
to persist in the cache. In the case of mutt that might mean happy mailing 
without having to enter a passwords every time a call is made. Pretty sweet
:smile:.

The entire agent business works in the following manner:

  - invoke the agent daemon (which runs in the background, presents the 
  passphrases for keys it has stored in cache and prompting you for the 
  passphrase it hasn't yet stored)
  - set up a terminal to act as the front-end

### Simplified
In order to simplify this entire process I have written a small shell script
to handle all of the daemon summoning and front-end spawning work.

Running `start-gpg-agent` checks if the info file doesn't yet exist and 
then spawns the daemon.

Basically I use the helper `make-gpg-tty` to configure my current terminal
as the GPG-Agent front-end. Mind you that you should only configure one 
terminal as the front-end in order to avoid weird :shit:. 
That is why `make-gpg-tty` stores the agent terminal number to a file and
only links the current terminal as the front-end if there has not already been
another terminal linked for this chore.

In order to disconnect my current terminal I can use `unmake-gpg-tty` and
if I want to stop the GPG-Agent I could run `stop-gpg-agent`.

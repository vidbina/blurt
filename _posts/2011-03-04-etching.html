Friday... ahh, picked up a nice little package my parents send my sister and I, ran a few little errands (bills related), made another stupid buy (batteries) and got a few photosensitive prints from the local electronics DIY store (http://www.dil.nl). For the first time ever... I made a quick trip to the the nearest civil amenity site to dispose of the chemicals I have been etching with eversince -- (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and NaOH.

Yeah apart from trying to build cool stuff I have to see to it that I do it responsibly and flushing that crap down the drain would be the small-scale environmental equivalent of everything the good Lord forbid us to do. Nahh... seriously... it's a bleach based substance... couldn't do too much harm -- I hope. But yeah... I'm not a chemist therefore I it probably was a wiser move to dispose of it properly :P.

Anyways... this not being a tech blog, I will keep the technical specifics to a minimum, but still try to share as much of "etching" as I possibly can. Etching?!? Yeah... that's what we do to blank PCB's to get a final PCB. PCB... printed circuit board... A day in my life...

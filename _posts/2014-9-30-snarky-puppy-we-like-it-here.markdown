[Michael League and the other extraordinary gents and dames](http://www.snarkypuppy.com) have been putting it
down for several years. Due to circumstances I wasn't able to witness their
awesomeness at North Sea Jazz this year, but a while ago I gazed at their
awesomeness when they performed the groundUP repetoire in Rotterdam. This year
they released [We Like It Here](http://snarkypuppy.ropeadope.com/album/we-like-it-here)
and I find this is a must have in every music-lovers collection. After a few
months of getting high on this joint I now could keep it to myself any longer.

Any of my musician friends that do not own this album are missing out and quite
frankly I wouldn't know why we are still talking :rage:.

Anyways... I just visited my barber and got him hooked on Snarky's latest
stuff . Whilst hacking away on another Rails application I
couldn't resist the urge to view a few videos online and now I just have to
share some of this dope :notes:.

If there is something you should watch tonight let it be this awesome performance
by the [puppies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snarky_Puppy). Cory Henry absolutely kills this one
:astonished:.

Whatever happens right after the 4 minutes, 18 seconds marker nearly had me
explode in front of my screen... mind-blown up! :fire:

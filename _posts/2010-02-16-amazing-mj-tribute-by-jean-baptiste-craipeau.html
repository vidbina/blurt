<div>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BE9m-RK4ks]Nothing from the brain this time. I was just doing some homework when I got this video through twitter. Wow!!! If you wanna see something amazing, check out this guy - Jean-Baptiste Craipeau. He's doing some crazy things on youtube; recording songs in a capella over multiple tracks to get all the "instrument" parts down. Check out his rendition of Michael Jackson's <em>Rock My World</em>. It's the best tribute I've heard so far. Beatboxing, singing... He does it all!!!</div>

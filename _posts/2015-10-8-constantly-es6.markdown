description: Note to self about ECMAscript 6 constants, the pass-by-reference and pass-by-value ordeal and few tips to remember which may aid in maintaining sanity within (if you really don't want other devs to kill you).

While reading up about housekeeping the global object in ECMAscript 6 I
noticed a subtlety of `const` that could have escaped the attention of some
software developers like myself.

Non-primitives such as arrays and objects are
accessed by their pointers and constants to such items pertain to the
reference.

A constant array or object always maintains its reference[^1],
but the
data pointed to by the immutable reference may be mutated.

[^1]: The pointer never changes, meaning that it will always point to the same item in memory.

{% highlight javascript %}
const number = 12;
number++; // fails, integers are primitive
{% endhighlight %}

Changing the reference will not work for an array, however; one may mutate
the object referred to by use of the `push`, `pop`, `shift` and `unshift`
functions:

{% highlight javascript %}
const people = [];
people.push('Leni') // ok
people = []; // fails, don't reassign
{% endhighlight %}

The data referred to by an object reference may also be mutated:

{% highlight javascript %}
const thing = {};
thing['name'] = 'Spaceship'; // ok
thing = { 'name': 'Paperplane' } // fails, don't reassign
{% endhighlight %}

Upon first glance it isn't far fetched to assume that somewhere in the 
life cycle of a codebase, someone will mistake a constant for an item of
immutable state. :warning:. Here is how I maintain sanity:

 - remember that primitives are passed by value
 - remember that non-primitives are passed by a _copy of the reference_[^3]
 - always return copies to non-primitives, ensuring that no one has access
 to the data I need for my housekeeping effectively giving me some guarantees
 regarding state.

[^2]: The reference to the array is taken by functions as `push`, `pop`, `shift` and `unshift` and the data pointed to by the reference is mutated. The reference never changes.

[^3]: As phrased by [Alnitak](http://stackoverflow.com/users/6782/alnitak) in an answer to [Does JavaScript pass by reference?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13104494/does-javascript-pass-by-reference)

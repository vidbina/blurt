description: Note-to-self about ES6 constants and a few tips to remember if you really don't want other devs to kill you.

While reading up about housekeeping the global object in ECMAscript 6, I
noticed a subtlety of `const` that could have escaped the attention of some
software developers like myself so I'm writing this post especially to
help me remember :bulb:... because I need to be careful for the seemingly immutable, yet capable of change.

Non-primitives such as arrays and objects are
accessed through their pointers and constants to such items pertain to the
reference and not the data referred to.

A constant array or object therefore always maintains its reference[^1],
but the data pointed to by the immutable reference may be mutated.

[^1]: The pointer never changes, meaning that it will always point to the same item in memory.

```javascript
const number = 12;
number++; // fails, integers are primitive
```

In the case of an array one may mutate the object referred to by use of the
`push`, `pop`, `shift` and `unshift` functions as demonstrated in
the following snippet:

```javascript
const people = [];
people.push('Leni') // ok
people = []; // fails, don't reassign
```

The data referred to by an object reference may also be mutated:

```javascript
const thing = {};
thing['name'] = 'Spaceship'; // ok
thing = { 'name': 'Paperplane' } // fails, don't reassign
```

Upon first glance it isn't far fetched to assume that somewhere in the
life cycle of a codebase, someone will mistake a constant for an item of
immutable state. :warning:. Here is how I maintain sanity:

 - remember that primitives are passed by value
 - remember that non-primitives are passed by a _copy of the reference_[^3]
 - always return copies to non-primitives, ensuring that no one has access
 to the data I need for my housekeeping, effectively giving me some
 guarantees regarding state.

[^2]: The reference to the array is taken by functions as `push`, `pop`, `shift` and `unshift` and the data pointed to by the reference is mutated. The reference never changes.

[^3]: As phrased by [Alnitak](http://stackoverflow.com/users/6782/alnitak) in an answer to [Does JavaScript pass by reference?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13104494/does-javascript-pass-by-reference)

  Just got in an awkward social predicament by using gender-based title
  in an effort to be polite. The things we do without actively thinking
  about why we do them and where they are from.

Thinking to be polite, I just addressed a lady by the title "sir". In the
split-second in which my brain realised I would have to ask her to keep a
watchful eye over my stuff it deduced that a "sporty outfit" and a
_bald head_ had a high probability of fitting the _male_ profile.

Well... I was wrong :pensive:. Technically, I was correct but any trained
classifier is bound to make some misclassifications from time to time. This
misclassification is perfectly palatable when we're just working the math
but becomes painful when materialized into a social encounter.


She could have been a cancer patient. I meant absolutely no harm, in fact,
the usage of a title was simply done out of respect. You could say that
my efforts to be "nice" inflicted some harm after all. Understandably she
was visibly annoyed by this and despite the fact that I apologised, I
probably contributed to one of the multiple dreaded episodes of her day.

<div class="element note">
This encounter served as a reminder that the problems we are analysing or
modelling have a real impact on human lives. It's comfortable to hide behind
data and models and keep the entire ordeal an intellectual exercise, but it
isn't limited to simply a puzzle. Economic models impact families, those
classifiers that identify health risks will impact lives and our deduction will
too. Somewhere a doctor will eventually deliver good or bad news to someone
after analysing the suggestions we generated through our classifiers or other
types of machine learning models. Always remember that, self.
</div>

I know our mind generalizes and intuitively deduces things to offload
some work from our active though processes. By not overanalyzing every
detail, we reserve some cognitive capacity for other things which eventually
allow us to do the cool things us humans do, but everything has a flip
side.

Most of us are probably raised to address people by titles. Not just "no"
but "no, sir". Not just "yes" but "yes, ma'am". How do you avoid gender
titles without sounding too casual or perhaps disrespectful? At some point
you are bound to offend someone it seems. Offending the prick who feels
entitled to be addressed by title or offending the person who is already
fighting enough bullshit to have to deal with another one of our archaic
social constructs?

It's not just about mentally modelling the world in a manner that is more
accepting towards those crossing or jittering about the gender chasms, but
also about not being the _proverbial dick_ to address cancer-fighting
ladies by a title society has reserved for men.

Then again you could ask... why should the recipient of the title usage
be sensitive about the title they are addressed by?!? There are many
sides to this.

<div class="element note">
I for one, remember being offended when I was constantly addressed as a lady
before my voice broke simply because I wanted to be associated to masculinity
and the title was a big part of it. I was a little nerdy and very insecure
little boy. Insecurity not being a rare trait for anyone in the sensitive
pre-teen and teen years. I wanted so many things as a child.  Wanted to be
older, wanted to be bigger, wanted to be independent, wanted no-one to tell me
which vegetables to eat, wanted to be able to go to the supermarket and buy
whatever the fuck I wanted... now things are slightly different. Got all of
those things, lost some of the carefreeness. Pros and cons, right?!?
:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
</div>

Mind you, I'm not saying the social construct is out of place. It is there
for a reason, I suppose, however; in light of our recent understanding of
the complexity and non-dichotomous nature of "gender" that it is probably
wise to consider modifying our language to reflect our new understanding.

Perhaps this modification of language isn't an active process, but more of
an organic change that we'll have to evolve through over the course of the
next years, decades or perhaps centuries.

Meanwhile, I'll be more careful about title attribution. Perhaps I'll just
talk less :speak_no_evil:

If we could just apply regular expressions in natural language...

Excuse me, .*

Social constructs are so complicated, back to machines...

<p>The voices of Common and Jill Scott add some of the wonderful colors on
Glasper's album.</p>

<p>It is truly remarkable how Glasper consistently succeeds in
composing very &ldquo;simple&rdquo; songs which sound so full and awesome. He
makes it look so easy &ndash; like he's effortlessly
shaking these remarkable sounds from his sleeves through his board.</p>

<p>Glasper has been one of my study subjects for a while now. Every time I
listen I hear new things. I've also witness him play live, on what may be
considered one of his least better days (he was probably a bit stressed maybe
even frustrated as the main performer of the night had missed his flight). Yet
whilst stressed he still managed to dazzle the audience with his musical
genius.</p>

<p>Surprise, surprise! While covering this week&#8217;s material for the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/socialpsychology-001/class">Social Psychology</a> class offered on Coursera by Professor Scott Plous I learned another fascinating thing about the human mind in a social context. A phenomenon commonly referred to as the <em>bystander effect</em> challenges the sense of safety many of us may have while in the presence of our fellow humans.<!-- more --></p>
<p>In previous lectures we&#8217;ve discussed how humans gain a sense of anonymity as members of a collective allowing them to engage in dastardly activities. This sense of anonimity would explain how angry mobs obtain the capacity to accomplish heinous crimes when none of the individual constituents would probably commit such behavior when alone &#8212; A phenomenon referred to as deindividuation.</p>
<p>This week we took a look from the other side: instead of groups participating in an event, we observed the behavior of groups observing and responding to an event.</p>
<p><span>Usually one may have a sense of safety when surrounded by people (I know I do). Against my expectations, however; I just learned that the possibility of obtaining help is inversely proportional to the amount of people in your vicinity. John Darley stated in the documentary </span><em>The Bystander Effect</em><span> that the responsibility any individual feels for helping is diffused when there are other people that could also help.</span></p>

<p>Sadly enough the stories of Deletha Word and Kitty Genovese are examples of this phenomenon in action.</p>
<p>As responsibility is diffused among the present bystanders, you&#8217;re better of addressing one person in particular when uttering your cry for help &#8212; directing the responsibility at one individual rather than broadcasting it to the entire group. We&#8217;re trained not to be intrusive or nosy &#8212; we&#8217;re trained to <strong>mind our own business</strong>. I guess this training paid off, because we generally avoid getting involved in other people&#8217;s affairs but it isn&#8217;t always beneficial to us.</p>
<p>The safety we experience when surrounded by many friendly faces may very well be called a social illusion, because when the going gets tough and we might need some help, well trained, law-abiding people try their very best not to intrude.</p>

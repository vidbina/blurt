title: ! 'The programmer, who needs clarity, who must talk all day to a machine

  that demands declarations, hunkers down into a low-grade annoyance.

  It is here that the stereotype of the programmer, sitting in a dim

  room, growling from behind Coke cans, has its origins.  The disorder

  of the desk, the floor; the yellow Post-It notes everywhere; the

  whiteboards covered with scrawl: all this is the outward manifestation

  of the messiness of human thought.  The messiness cannot go into the

  program; it piles up around the programmer.'

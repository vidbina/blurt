<p>Have you tried studying or writing code to this track? I imaging myself
lost somewhere in a grassy field between the hills, jumping around making the
occasional pirouette. What music can do to the imagination&#133;</p>

<p>For those doing home videos&#133; this would work nicely to the videos of a
toddler&rsquo;s first encounters.</p>
<p>That first time meeting a puppy or that first time at the beach.
That look of fascination and total awe. That infant touch which evolves into 
thorough groping and poking experiments, followed by the many inevitable
attempts to confirm whether the object of fascination happens to be edible. As
the last tone is striked we witness the toddler watching the puppy run off in
the distance, or the sun set behind the horizon&#133; the
picture slowly fades as the amplitude of that final D-flat sets. Fin.</p>

<p>Full of energy and very joyously performed is the Waltz in E-flat. I can
imagine some unshot scenes that this music would work perfectly with (in my
imagination at least).</p>

<p>Chopin obviously mastered capturing different moods in his music. I could
imagine this working well to a scene in need of a romantic touch, but this
would also work well to a scene of a master teaching his young apprentice, or
the boss educating the wiseguys &mdash; I guess any act of giving could be
accompanied by this soundscape.</p>

<p>The obvious minor setting in this suspenseful composition could seems to
announce something that I'm as of yet unaware of. Yet it feels as if this
composition isn't all about minor moods. I imagine a physicist working on his
theories, probably one that leads him to a dead-end.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re more into the suspenseful stuff the following composition by
Chopin might do the trick.</p>

<h1>The Rich Pallete of&#8230;</h1>
<p>I just arrived home after my first encounter with wine tasting ever. A couple of great and mediocre flavors (personal opinion) with a aromatic palette ranging from fermenting mangos, to bananas and wooden barrels. The most intriguing palette however was the stunning palette of qualities from people from all walks of live that I encountered.<!-- more --></p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite aware of the fact that humans are utterly fascinating creatures. I&#8217;m quite aware of the fact that every encounter is a dormant suprise waiting to errupt in a glorious cacophony of glorious discoveries, yet I still manage to get caught off guard.</p>
<p>Good wines and wonderful conversations. From Roy the philosopher who has mentioned some interesting facts about the works of Plato, Aristotles and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander">Anaximander</a> (whom I had never heard of before) to Jacqueline, a vibrant woman who managed to unload a motherload of positive energy (without attempting to sound mystical at all, she was just the type of person you would love to meet again and again). I haven&#8217;t yet mentioned anything about this amazing Rob character, but that is a story for another time.</p>
<p>Some people are wonderful and I&#8217;m convinced that expression of such observations is something we could do more often. Take a good look at the next remarkable specimen you encounter and express your gratitude for their acquaintance.</p>
<p>But yes&#8230; where were we? A wine tasting. I would recommend <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dona+dolca+moscatel">Dona Dolça Moscatel</a>. A dessert wine with a refreshingly fresh (is there any other fresh?) aroma. To me the aromatic freshness nearly approached the level of &#8220;medically sterile&#8221;. In retrospect it is probably a wrong choice of words for someone who&#8217;s trying to get readers to try the wine in question but this was my first impression. It&#8217;s pretty much a wine you could sprinkle behind the ears like you do your musk. The flavor is ridden with sweetness, a bit of honey, something remotely apple-esque &#8212; simply divine. Simple divine seems quite an oxymoronic phrase as the divine is anything but simple but I&#8217;m conviced the idea is clearly communicated. Then again, it is all a matter of taste, and this somehow just matched my palette of preference.</p>

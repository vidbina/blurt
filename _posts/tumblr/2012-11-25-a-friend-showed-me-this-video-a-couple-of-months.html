<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/50976572" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe><br/><p>A friend showed me this video a couple of months ago. The <a href="http://radicalmedia.com" target="_blank">RadicalMedia</a> creative minds have delivered a short film worthy of being listed in the same category of a film such as <em>Minority Report</em> with regards to special effects and creativity and <em>The Echelon Conspiracy</em> with regards to security and privacy considerations. Like other science-fiction films, this short-film succeeds in initiating the long thought sessions about the direction in which we&#8217;re headed.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling#DNA_family_relationship_analysis" target="_blank">DNA family relationship analysis</a> has led to a big break in the resolution prospects of a <a href="http://nos.nl/artikel/442161-zaak-marianne-vaatstra-de-feiten.html" target="_blank">cold case in the Netherlands</a>. This success has sparked the suggestion by some to initiate a DNA sampling effort to attain the profiles of every Dutch citizen. I don&#8217;t have to go into great lengths to indicate that there has been a wave of resistance and critique from the privacy-guarding front. I don&#8217;t really know how the situation will unfold but I do understand both sides of the camp.</p>
<p>A DNA database would allow faster identification of bodies after disasters. Such a database would also allow faster identification of suspects who might have played a significant role in a crime. It is also understandable that some are not at ease submitting such information, feeling that yet another aspect of their life is no longer theirs to control &#8212; privacy down the drains. These people feel totally helpless with the advent of the Big Brother, quantify-everything-you-can and store-data-in-a-cloud-controlled-by-a-party-you-hardly-know society of which there seems no escaping from.</p>
<p>The future! Plenty of material to keep some awake at night and plenty of material to keep others at ease. For now&#8230; just enjoy this awesome short.</p>

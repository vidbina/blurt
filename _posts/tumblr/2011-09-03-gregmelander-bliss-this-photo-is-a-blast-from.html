  BLISS 

  This photo is a blast from my past. I came across this article (Ever wonder where
  the Windows XP default wallpaper came from?) I just so happened to be the designer
  who helped choose this image for XP in 2001 and contrary to what this article says,
  yes, I did end up making slight Photoshop modifications. I raised the saturation
  levels, adjusted a few flowers in the foreground, took out a few clouds in the sky
  and adjusted the mountain the far distance. At the time I would have never thought
  this image would become so prevalent around the world. I also ended up doing the
  silver and olive themes for XP back in the day. Later on I also did the black XP
  theme for media center. That was my favorite one.

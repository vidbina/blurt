<p>So I&#8217;ve decided to partner up with a good friend who&#8217;s had my back ever since I started and am finally discovering how &#8220;partnering&#8221; up with the right person is really creating me more time.<!-- more --></p>
<p>First of all I decided to partner because I found myself spending more time organizing stuff, acquiring gigs, attending events and travelling to and from meetings then actually delivering the service I&#8217;m selling in the first place. Even worse, some of these tasks are things I&#8217;m not particularly awesome at. The situation was at times frustrating as I felt that I was spending my resources in a manner that was far from efficient.</p>
<p>You might be familiar with the warm-up and cool-down phases during work cycles and the amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muda_(Japanese_term)" title="Muda on Wikipedia" target="_blank">muda (無駄)</a> you introduce by fragmenting your effective work streaks for the other important chores. It takes time to get into the zone and it really isn&#8217;t cost effective if you have to get into the zone too often as your best work generally isn&#8217;t delivered during the getting-in-the-zone phases. Once there, you&#8217;re yielding like crazy, so stay there if possible. I too prefer long stretches of top-notch yield and very few interruptions, but with all the different things I had to take care of on a weekly basis I found it hard to maintain sufficiently productive uninterrupted work runs.</p>

<p>For two weeks I&#8217;ve been going totally HAM now and I&#8217;m loving it. My partner in crime picks up all the stuff that I&#8217;m not a hulk at. He does, however; talk a lot though. Sometimes he gets really exited over ideas and feels the urgent need to still interrupt me to tell me about them, but I guess we&#8217;ll find a way to make it work for the both of us over time. For the time being he&#8217;s jumping on trains, conducting meetings, making phone calls, reading contracts, doing due diligence, validating ideas and putting all of his social cunningness to play to allow me more space in my schedule to build the stuff I need to build.</p>
<p>It feels like I&#8217;ve never had this much time to get stuff done. We just created time for me by our strategically played collaborative efforts!</p>
<p>This is awesome!!!</p>

  check when we were just going through the bodily changes that made deodorant necessary.

  Now I’m using “real” deodorants… until two weeks ago. I got rid of any traces of
  metal, petroleum, silicon or chemicals I know nothing about. You would be surprised
  what they have you rub under your armpits.

  Anyways, lemons and limes were what the elderly recommend the youngings back in
  Suriname. Now I squeeze a fresh one into a little spray can every week and I’m good
  to go.

  I still sweat. As a matter of fact, I sweat more since my armpit’s pores are no
  longer constricted but lo and behold… no funky odors.

  I have no time to figure our why this works but it does. Two hectic weeks in the
  Dutch summer have made this quite clear to me and to my business partner who’s in
  on this as well.'

  Magnus Gjoen

  Magnus Gjoen’s prints examine how to change peoples relationship and preconceived
  notions of objects. Something which is potentially extremely destructive can be
  made into beautiful yet fragile objects of art. It’s this misconception of beauty
  which Magnus Gjoen wants us to see in a different light, being it weapons, animals
  or the human race itself. The latter which is capable of creating immense beauty
  but also capable of destroying it all. Taking inspiration from street and pop art
  and juxtapositioning it with fine art, he creates new and modern takes on old masterpieces
  or manipulates something powerful and strong into something fragile but beautiful.
  He often questions the correlation between religion, war, beauty & destruction in
  his art. Magnus Gjoen was born in London to Norwegian parents and studied design
  in London and Milan and works as a designer/graphic designer for Vivienne Westwood.

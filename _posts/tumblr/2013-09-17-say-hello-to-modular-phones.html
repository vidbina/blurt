<a href="http://thndr.it/14IFdTv">Say Hello to Modular Phones</a><br/><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about modular devices before, never did anything serious with the idea because I know the amount of work required to get such projects off the ground (I&#8217;m aware of the fact that there are significant technological challenges to overcome). I don&#8217;t have an ocean of time at my disposal but this guy seems to have found a nice way to go about it. Get the world interested in the project and subsequently muster a team of engineers to get to it.</p>

<p>I think this project definitely deserves a try.</p>

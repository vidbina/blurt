title: ! 'I’m still amped from BubbleConf last Friday in Tuschinksy, Amsterdam… I’ve
  heard the illustrious Mike Lee speak (like a demigod) and chatted (2 or 3 sentences)
  with the notorious Zed A. Shaw (served a talk like a heavyweight boxer) after which
  I’ve googled these giants like crazy the last few days.

  After a refreshing weekend rehashing some knowledge from that dusty chest I’m back
  on my coding grind. Yup this weekend I’ve read Learn Python the Hard Way (Zed A.
  Shaw), done all the exercises and started delving into the web2py documentation.
  I already knew Python which is the reason why I was able to work through this book
  in 2 days, but you’d be amazed at how much things you kinda forget after long periods
  of coding in other languages. In retrospect it’s probably a good practice to flip
  through some programming guides/books now and then to (re)discover some hidden gems
  (as long as you try ideas right away… practice, practice, practice).

  Currently I’m totally in love with web2py. It is probably one of the most coder-friendly
  full stack frameworks I’ve bumped my head against and it’s written in one of the
  most elegant languages ever.

  IMHO… no facts… just opinions. Just needed to get that out.

  I’m also making considerable progress on a couple of Android apps (prototypes) I’m
  coding, and I’ve had my first encounters with Objective C.

  But that would explain why I’m amped. I’m learning a lot, discovering great tools,
  bumping into legends and looking forward to a adventurous future. Also have a couple
  of themesongs from my Spotify playlist banging on my eardrums. I’m feeling like
  the protagonist from a film… my own movie :D — I’m kinda nuts… soo nuts, but who
  gives a hoot.

  back to coding…'

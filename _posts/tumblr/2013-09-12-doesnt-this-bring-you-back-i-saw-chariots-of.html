<p>Doesnâ€™t this bring you back? I saw <i>Chariots of Fire</i> as a little kid
not more then 10 years of age. I still remember the athletes running on the
beach with grey skies above. The rest is very vague but the music, however;
never faded from my memory. Time for a rewatch. I hope they have it on Netflix.

Speaking of classic sports films... I also remember the movie Tracks of Glory
which tells the tale of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Taylor">african-american cyclist Mayor Taylor</a>
This movie is not remotely related to Vangelis&rsquo; work, but thinking about
<i>Chariots of Fire</i> got me wander off to to <i>Tracks of Glory</i>. I guess
we can attribute the &ldquo;wandering off&rdquo; to the poetic titles of these
films &agrave; la <span>NOUN of &lt;SOMETHING AWESOME (FORCE OR VIRTUE)&gt;</span>.

<iframe src="http://www.xtranormal.com/xtraplayr/6995033/mongo-db-is-web-scale" width="400" height="247" frameborder="0"></iframe><br/><p>I&#8217;m researching some storage options for a project currently in the pipelines. While reading some related articles, technical references, posts and comments I stumbled unto this awesome short. Kinda silly and somewhat ridiculous especially if you try to imagine that this is the type of material I run into during my research sessions *bows head in shame* but I did.</p>
<p>If anyone has a couple of tips regarding storage options that support geospatial indexing and the execution of proximity queries on not only <em>points</em> but also <em>linestrings </em>and other geometrical entities, please drop me a note.</p>
<p><span>At the moment I&#8217;m looking at MongoDB and PostGIS.</span></p>

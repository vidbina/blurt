<p>We&#8217;re approaching Rotterdam as my fingers race against time to hammer this message unto my screen. Just had a great few chats at a <a href="http://meetup.appsterdam.rs/events/87026762/" target="_blank">Appsterdam Meet &amp; Drink</a> gathering at <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/caf%C3%A9-bax/4a270020f964a52049821fe3" title="Cafe Bax on Foursquare" target="_blank">Cafe Bax</a>. Spoke with one of the <a href="http://le.mu.rs/" target="_blank">New Lemurs</a> devs about their approach and connected with other entrepreneurial dreamers and tinkerers.</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend entrepreneurial minds to make the time to attend one of these meetups (somewhere in their lifetime). The stories from fellow megaminds are inspiring. I did the chatting over a couple glasses of water, chicken sates, fries and a beer. Yup, the meetup joint serves decent food.</p>
<p>Straight from a client near Rotterdam to Amsterdam, for a bit to eat and a couple of nourishing conversations and now I&#8217;m headed back home.</p>
<p>Good night! Great folks! I&#8217;m aching to discover more great minds and unearth other inspiring stories from Appsterdammers in the near future ;)</p>

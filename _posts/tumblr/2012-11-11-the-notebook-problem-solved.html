<p>Let&#8217;s skip the smalltalk, let&#8217;s get to business. Lately I&#8217;ve been taking a lot of udemy/coursera/udx courses and I&#8217;ve always been either, doodling in a carbon-based notebook or writing form-less text files on my computer. Gradually I started using Markdown but with the significance of math in my line of work, expressing concepts through mathematical notation is a indispensable luxury. I&#8217;ve always been forced to jump to TeX if I really felt the need to get technical and I still think that TeX is awesome but just a couple of minutes ago I bumped into <em><a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demos.html#try-pandoc-online">pandoc</a></em> whilst roaming around the internet in my quest for something more convenient.</p>

<p>Input notes by writing Markdown, add some formulas by enclosing them within the TeX-ish dollar signs and pandoc it into whatever you really want, a TeX file, a PDF, a HTML file or maybe even a Word Document (my least favorite). Bliss!!!</p>
<p>I guess the best way to experience its awesomeness is by <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html">installing</a> pandoc and <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demos.html">playing</a> with some of it&#8217;s awesome features.</p>
<p>As for me?!? I&#8217;m in love. My notebooks are disappearing in a box and I&#8217;m going pandoc. I&#8217;ve already rewritten pretty much all of my notes, and my Makefiles are ready to generate whatever my heart craves at the push of a button.</p>

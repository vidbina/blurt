<p>Humans are fascinating creatures. So fascinating you can&#8217;t help but love them, but even so are the other creatures that wander the earth.</p>
<p>I spends hours gazing at birds working their magic, living their seemingly carefree lives. I get emotional hearing the remarkable stories of unrelenting loyalty that man&#8217;s best friend is capable of exhibiting. I am amazed at the treasures you uncover by simple conversation. I am silenced by the impressive glory radiated by the the sculptures of nature.</p>
<p>There are a lot of stories intertwined on this small spherical hunk of mass we call Earth. The most remarkable graph could probably be created by simply mapping the relationships between these individual story lines.</p>
<p>The story of that pebble, once part of a impressive rock, that washes to shore a couple of miles downstream. The antelope by the shore, helping itself to the refreshing nourishment offered by the stream, has a story of its own, as does the stream, let alone the stories told by the most obvious storytellers, us, humans. Storytelling is our way of life. The relay of information from a grandfather to a grandchild, from a professor to a student, from a salesman to a unsuspecting buyer, from the politician to the voter, from the artist to the listener, from the illusionist to the observer, from the sage the the apprentice, from you to me and now from me to you.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t help but stand in awe when you realise how intricately we&#8217;re all woven together into the canvas the virtuoso expresses its genius on. We&#8217;re the fibres that constitute the cloth of tales, and that connection extends beyond the bounds of creatures as a whole as every shed molecule starts a journey of its own.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that amazing?</p>
<p>I love you earthlings &#8212; I really do!</p>

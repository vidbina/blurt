<blockquote cite="http://rapgenius.com/Jay-z-no-hook-lyrics">
  <p>&ldquo;Stay outta trouble,&rdquo;<br/>
  momma said as momma sighed</p>

  <p>Her fear: her youngest son<br/>
  be a victim of homicide</p>

  <p>But I gotta get you outta here momma,<br/>
  or I&rsquo;mma die <br/>
  &#8230;inside</p>

  <p>And either way, you lose me momma<br/>
  so let loose of me</p>

  <p>I got the rein <br/>
  our direction will soon change</p>

<p>These lines in <a href="http://rapgenius.com/Jay-z-no-hook-lyrics">No Hook</a>
apply to different lives in different forms. Some don&rsquo;t risk homicides,
but burn-outs. Some don&rsquo;t need to be told to stay &ldquo;out of
trouble&rdquo;, but &ldquo;out of stress&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It tells the tales of sons and daughters fighting to the death, as in
giving every drop of energy available&#8230; even if it is just to provide
themselves the inner peace of having tried everything within reach to provide
their loved ones and themselves an alternative to &#8220;being broke&#8221;.</p>

<p>I know a few&#8230;</p>

<p>Momma tells me not to get overworked. She obviously wants me around for a
long time&#8230; question is&#8230; would I be content with being around for a
long time under any condition? Any condition that allows me to proudly say
&ldquo;momma, I made it&rdquo; will do.</p>

<p>The rest&#8230; Unacceptable!</p>

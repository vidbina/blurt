<h1>The Greatest Editors</h1>
It was quite a while ago when I decided to thrown away Eclipse, Netbeans, CodeBlocks and all my other former IDE's out of pure frustration. My computer at the time... a beige P4 box... would often spend about a minute just rendering a pull-down menu; obviously a condition I was unwilling to live with which led to Emacs/Vim became my editors of choice. Now, a few months later, I couldn't imagine going back to regular IDE's. I've done some Android, some Ruby on Rails, some AVR-GCC coding projects without anything of a glitch.</p>

<h1>Freedom</h1>
<p>Since last week I got my old (better computer) back, that trusty old AMD Athlon XP. I got a cheap AM2 board for 44 big ones and Lord, this thing is much faster than that which I had to bear with for so long. I'm still on Emacs and Vim though -- I'm still on Ubuntu. WinXP and MacOS in VM's but everything else is tux-based at the moment. I finally landed in my tux comfort zone. I've been using Linux on-and-off ever since I were a kid (Mandrake, DSL, Kill Bill and then Ubuntu) but never really became a full-time user until lately. I had Windows as an option, was used to the environment and had no real reasons to look for an alternative; besides, I had the excuse that Windows was capable of doing much more because of the amount of software that was available for the platform. It was just playing around that I did at the time but what can I say -- I was a kid. Now, being forced to look for alternatives by the hardware issues I have been facing I have been able to take a better look at tux. A little bit beyond the surface. It's cool... I'm comfortable... I'm probably not going anywhere for the next year.</p>

<p>I got a tux-distro on my flash drive which I use on school computers, tux on my home computer, tux on the computer I'm using at the intern position, tux on my phone :) I've heard one refer to me as a "hippie" last week.</p>

<h1>Open-Source</h1>
<p>Well... One thing I might add is that I pretty much succeeded in finding a open-source solution to anything I was previously doing on Windows (except for SolidWorks). I've also regained a new awareness for the economics software development and lately have been refusing to crack everything I would ever need. That donate button, isn't just a strange phenomenon to me. I've done a fair deal of coding and am quite aware that some developers deserve to be rewarded for their effort.</p>

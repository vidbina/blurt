description: "I've been around in the startup game for a little while now
and every time a landing page is needed. I almost lose my mind over the amount
of time wasted on pixel-twerking instead of turning the knobs that could get
the company to grow. Many companies have great landing pages, learn from them
and focus on the business instead of webpages."

I think startups should spend more time on tweaking their business model and
gaining traction than building landing pages.

I'm absolutely stunned by [Magic](http://getmagicnow.com) which has the
simplest web page out there and seems to work wonders with it. Is it because
they are out there, bringing the ruckus, serving customers and learning from
their mistakes? All I know is that it is a big middle finger to the hustlers
out there who keep claiming that they need a _better website_ to convert
people.

This weekend I started stripping a few landing pages from a few companies that
are either feature as examples of how to do stuff in some articles or workshops
or just had a pretty page. Maybe 10 souls around the globe are screwing
around with a landing page at this moment while there is enough they can do to
make better use of their time (e.g.: talking to customers, helping customers,
automating part of the process to scale up the operation). Why shouldn't they
make better use of their time, right?

Working HTML/CSS isn't exactly my forte (better put, I'd rather write other
stuff), but because I needed another landing page I just had to hack something
together in a manner that may save me some time the next time I need to perform
this dance again.

The project is called [LandingStrip](http://github.com/vidbina/landing-strip)
because

 1. it basically features _(st)ripped_ versions of landing pages that are on
    the web and seem to be working and
 2. a place of landing for airplanes is sometimes referred to as a _strip_.

  <div class="github-card" data-github="vidbina/landing-strip" data-width="400" data-height="153" data-theme="default"></div>
  <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/github-cards/latest/widget.js"></script>
</div>

Apart from the wordplay in the use of the term strip, it also employs a
colorful double entendre.

[Landing strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway)
as a colloquialism for runway or a euphemism for the minimalistic pubic hairdo
works quite well in that regard.

Next time you're polishing pixels again, ask yourself if that is really going
to make the big difference in pushing your company into the list of winners
:trophy:.

I have stripped Magic, the old Buffer page and also Assist which has a nice
split pane layout.

Bear with me. In order to avoid copyright infringement or abuse of trademarks
I have given all the strips alternative names. A listing of the strips is
available on the [project page](https://github.com/vidbina/landing-strip).

Speaking about making that difference, I'm working on getting up there too and
damn it is hard! This is why I try to avoid spending the precious little time
I have on things that will not make a ground shattering difference for my
startups. I will not get that time back and often enough when you tell yourself
it needs to look a little better, it is just **you bullshitting yourself with
excuses that will keep you from the really hard stuff**. The really hard stuff
that could make the difference. Don't do that to yourself :wink:.

Stay Lean, Be Focused, Go Hard!

P.S.: Normally I would have spent a few extra days polishing it up. Just to
protect my street cred. Then again... Fuck it, ship it
:shipit:! If it renders imperfectly in some browsers, I
hope a greater wielder of the CSS/HTML swords will help me out... after getting
his/her landing page up first. Because we ship landing pages to hook people,
not to win awards for aesthetics. I made up mine.

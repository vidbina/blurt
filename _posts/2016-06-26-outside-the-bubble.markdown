  The Brits voted for Brexit. The shared sentiment throughout a lot of
  developed European city is not in support of Brittain's decision and I'm
  just trying to put things into perspective.

It was one of the Coursera Social Psychology professors that said something
that stopped me dead in my tracks a few years ago. The essence of his message
was that everything I would deem illogical is perfectly logically when
approached from another perspective. From that moment on, I have always tried
to understand situations coming from both perspectives which causes some
frustration among my friends because I come up with counterarguments too often,
simply as an exercise to encourage further thought.

The farmer welcomes the news of increasing potato prices and will take
appropriate measures to take full advantage of that. I don't have to spend much
words trying to explain why a clerk living from paycheck to paycheck will not
share the enthusiasm of our farmer.

In the end we all fight to survive. I've lived in countries where I've had the
privilege of observing how economics drive decisions of individuals and I can
not judge anyone for doing exactly the same thing that I am doing. It's about
survival.

People think to understand the situation better than they really do, just like
many of us consider ourselves better than average drivers, or many consider
ourselves honest people while we share plenty of lies to cover our assess or
seemingly protect the feelings of others.

I need reminding myself yet again, that my entire worldview, like everybody
else's is severely tainted by our surrounding influences and circumstances and
though I may have a certain conviction in the ideals that I hold dear, I may
grossly overestimate or underestimate the merits of such ideals.


I've heard this joke a few times where blue-collars claim to produce the
wealth while it is consequently being spent in the places where the
white-collars dwell. The blue collars and the white collars generally don't
interact enough to fully understand each other's plights.

As a "big-city" software engineer who can make a decent living, I wouldn't
posses the understanding to truly empathize with the rural fishermen even if I
understand the numbers.

It is in tiny subsets of the population in cities where you run into crowds
that predominantly proclaim themselves "progressive" and "developed" were we
have assigned a tinge of negativity to the phrase "populistic", while we bear
the crown of proud democrats on our heads; often forgetting that a majority of
people do not share our circumstances. In fact, the populist agenda often
represents the views of a majority of the population and as true democrats we
have to realize that there nothing inherently good or evil about populism.

My friends are "big-city" dwellers, my social network is dominated by people
that share my circumstances and since you are reading this post, there is a
good chance that you somewhat share a lot of attributes that many of the people
in my regular crowd have.

The other point-of-view wouldn't find my viewfinder often enough, weren't it
for the fact that I still have family and friends living in less ideal
circumstances. It's because I know enough people on both sides of the line that
I am negligibly more sensitive to the real mechanics behind our economies.

To me, Europe feels amazing. I can move about the continent without much
hassle other than the occasional airport rituals. I can work for a variety of
clients. There is some legislation in place that is somewhat beneficial to me
in terms of travel, telecommunications and infrastructure.

I am also aware of certain perks of the EU that are less popular in my book.
Compliance is annoying, but you wouldn't know that if you're just writing
software[^q], making music or writing articles. The EU attempts to protect its
own by laws that may deter entrepreneurs with less means, but the corporations
can sure handle it. There is a reason why Brussels is lobby town.

The Danes have an curious relationship with the union. The Swiss aren't even
part of the union. Neither of these countries are doing particularly bad, in
fact both are doing exceptionally well. So a healthy existence as a non-model
member of the EU is possible. Membership comes at a price such as everything
else in this world, obviously. Adopting the [Acquis communautaire][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquis_communautaire], a corpus consisting of over 80000 pages that may take
precedence over national law when in conflict, sacrifices the sovereignty of a
state. If [the][power-of-lobbies] [lobbies][eu-lobby] are more successful
than the people in influencing whatever makes it into this bundle of
regulations and laws, one could ask how much the vote of a constituent of
any member state is worth since those elections have a national scope and the
elected officials are still subject to operate in compliance to the directives
set from the governing union. The bigger question perhaps is how democratic
Europe really is?

I enjoy the perks of the union, but I am aware of the sacrifices: the loss of
control for individual member states, the corporate influence through the
lobbies and some regulations that may be detrimental to certain industries.
I don't believe it's completely democratic, in fact, I'm one of those guys who
believe that the world is more oligarchic than democratic, but that is a topic
to be discussed over a glass of your best blend.

[^q]: It depending on what software you write.

In America the term "minority" will [change definition][minority-babies] soon
enough. Populism suffers the same fate.

[^1]: Yesterday I flew from Munich to Amsterdam and noticed that in my row I
was one of the few who had to sit down to allow the gate personnel to gather
residue samples from my hands and bags for drugs or other chemical substances.
It happens all the time so I stopped being bothered about it, but I also am no
longer naive enough to believe they're completely random.

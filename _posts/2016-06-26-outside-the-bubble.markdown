  The Brits voted for Brexit. Progressive western media isn't exceptionally
  positive about this outcome and I'm just trying to understand the pros and
  cons.

It was one of the Coursera Social Psychology professors that said something
that stopped me dead in my tracks a few years ago. The essence of his message
was that everything I would deem illogical is perfectly logically when
approached from another perspective. From that moment on, I have always tried
to understand situations coming from both perspectives which causes some
frustration in some people close to me because I come up with counterarguments
too often, simply as an exercise to encourage further thought.

The farmer welcomes the news of increasing produce prices and will take
appropriate measures to take full advantage of that. I don't have to spend much
words trying to explain why a clerk living from paycheck to paycheck will not
share the enthusiasm of the farmer.

In the end we all fight to survive. I've lived in countries where I've had the
privilege of observing how economics drive decisions of individuals at a more
primitive and basal level and I can not judge anyone for doing exactly the
same thing that I am doing albeit in a somewhat different form. It's about
survival and we all owe it to ourselves to safeguard it.

People generally assume to understand the situation better than they really do,
just like many of us consider ourselves better than average drivers, or many
consider ourselves honest people while we share plenty of lies to cover our
assess or seemingly "protect the feelings of others". It's one of the cognitive
biases that have haunted us for at least as long as we have self-documented
historic accounts.

I remind myself yet again, that my entire worldview, like everybody else's is
severely tainted by our surrounding influences and circumstances and though I
may have a certain conviction in the ideals that I hold dear, I may grossly
overestimate or underestimate their merits.

Just travel around the globe to enough countries and you'll find a somewhat
recurring pattern where blue collars claim to produce the wealth while it is
consequently being spent in the places where the white collars dwell. The
age-old struggle between the blue collared vs. white collared, the hardhats vs.
the suit. With the current state of our segregated work ecosystems the blue
collars and the white collars generally don't interact enough to fully
understand each other's plights, let alone be emphatic towards members of the
other group.

As a _big-city_ software engineer who can make a decent living, I may not
posses the proper background to truly empathize with the rural fishermen
because of my detachment. I simply don't live the fisherman's live. Even if I
believe to understand the numbers, Kahneman would point out that I may not be
as skilled at performing statistical analysis as well as I, as human, may think
I can and maybe he was [exaggerating a bit](http://web.mit.edu/~cocosci/Papers/statistics-and-the-Bayesian-mind.pdf).

It is in tiny subsets of the population in cities where you run into crowds
that predominantly proclaim themselves "progressive" were we have assigned a
tinge of negativity to the phrase "populistic" while we bear the crowns of
proud democrats on our heads. I don't think we mean any harm, we probably
just forget that a true democracy honors the popular voice; which isn't
necessarily just our voice since we are vastly outnumbered in the "real" world.

We may know the statistics but still forget that the lives we live are nowhere
near representative of the populace, therefore our favorite choices in terms of
policy could potentially be detrimental to the majority of the individuals of a
nation. Is there anything inherently good or evil about populism?

My friends are "big-city" dwellers, my social network is dominated by people
that share my circumstances (jobs, college degrees, access to certain services
or privileges) and since you are reading this post, there is a good chance that
there is a significant common denominator between you and the group I'm talking
about.

The other point-of-view wouldn't find my viewfinder often enough, weren't it
for the fact that I still have family and friends living in less ideal
circumstances. It's because I know enough people on both sides of the line that
I am negligibly more sensitive to the real mechanics behind our economies.

To me, Europe feels amazing. I can move about the continent without much
hassle other than the occasional airport rituals. I can work for a variety of
clients. There is some legislation in place that is somewhat beneficial to me
in terms of travel, telecommunications and infrastructure.

I am also aware of certain perks of the EU that are less popular in my book.
Compliance is annoying, but you wouldn't know that if you're just writing
software[^q], making music or writing articles. The EU attempts to protect its
its interests by laws that may deter entrepreneurs with less means, but the
corporations can sure handle it. There is a reason why Brussels is lobby town.
As ofter seen in government, there exists or occurs a disparity between the
interests of the ruling classes and the working classes.

The Danes have an curious relationship with the union. The Swiss aren't even
part of the union. In fact they their longstanding application to join the
union was [withdrawn shortly before the Brits voted to breakup](https://www.rt.com/news/346884-switzerland-eu-membership-application-rejected/). The Icelandic folks had applied and withdrew as well
which may have been related to the Icesave debacle, a ruling party change and a
strong will to maintain sovereignty prior to the cancellation of their
membership application. Neither the Swiss, the Danes or the [Icelandic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/17/the-miraculous-story-of-iceland/) are doing particularly bad, in
fact both are doing exceptionally well. So a healthy existence as a non-model
member of the European continent is possible. Membership comes at a price such
as everything else in this world, obviously. Adopting the [Acquis communautaire][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquis_communautaire], a corpus consisting of over 80000 pages that may take
precedence over national law when in conflict, sacrifices the sovereignty of a
state. If [the][power-of-lobbies] [lobbies][eu-lobby] are more successful
than the people in influencing whatever makes it into this bundle of
regulations and laws, one could ask how much the vote of a constituent of
any member state is worth since those elections have a national scope and the
elected officials are still subject to operate in compliance to the directives
set from the governing union. The bigger question perhaps is how democratic
Europe really is?

I enjoy the perks of the union, but I am aware of the sacrifices: the loss of
control for individual member states, the corporate influence through the
lobbies and some regulations that may be detrimental to certain industries.
I don't believe it's completely democratic, in fact, I'm one of those guys who
believe that the world is more oligarchic than democratic, but that is a topic
to be discussed over a glass of your finest blend[^blend].

**PS.:** I just spoke with my girlfriend about this matter again, because I love to bug
her with political brain picking from to time and she seems a bit more
favorable of the union than I do. Her arguments helped me understand a few
things better. The EU is conceived as a means to unify a group of nations that
have plenty of reasons to focus on their distinctions than their similarities.
It's somewhat poignant that the idea of being from the same planet, let alone
the same continent isn't enough to get a sense of solidarity grounded in the
people. Perhaps Europe needs the EU to feel less fractured, but perhaps the EU
should be more democratic still.

What do I know though... Let's all just keep an open mind about the plight of
others and the true merits of the institutes we sustain, for [the end does not
always justify the means, or does it](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/the_end_justifies_the_means)?!?

[^q]: It depending on what software you write.
[^blend]: Actually, don't waste your finest blend on me. I probably wouldn't even taste the difference.

In America the term "minority" will [change definition][minority-babies] soon
enough. Populism suffers the same fate.

[^1]: Yesterday I flew from Munich to Amsterdam and noticed that in my row I
was one of the few who had to sit down to allow the gate personnel to gather
residue samples from my hands and bags for drugs or other chemical substances.
It happens all the time so I stopped being bothered about it, but I also am no
longer naive enough to believe they're completely random.

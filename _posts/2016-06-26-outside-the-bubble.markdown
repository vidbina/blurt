It was one of the Coursera Social Psychology professors that said something
that stopped me dead in my tracks a few years ago. The essence of his message
was that everything I would deem illogical is perfectly logically when
approached from another perspective. From that moment on, I have always tried
to understand situations coming from both perspectives which causes some
frustration among my friends because I come up with counterarguments too often,
simply as an exercise to encourage further thought.

The farmer welcomes the news of increasing potato prices and will take
appropriate measures to take full advantage of that. I don't have to spend much
words trying to explain why a clerk living from paycheck to paycheck will not
share the enthusiasm of our farmer.

In the end we all fight to survive. I've lived in countries where I've had the
privilege of observing how economics drive decisions of individuals and I can
not judge anyone for doing exactly the same thing that I am doing. It's about
livelihood.

This post is not as much about beaming opinions, but mostly about reminding
myself yet again, that my entire worldview, like everybody else's is severely
tainted by our surrounding influences and circumstances.

People think to understand the situation better than they really do, just like
many of us consider ourselves better than average drivers, or many consider
ourselves honest people while we share plenty of lies to cover our assess or
seemingly protect the feelings of others. The fisherman does the same.

Sometimes we should look at the [data][http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis]
to try to understand what is happening. As a "big-city" software engineer who
can make a decent living, I wouldn't posses the understanding to truly
empathize with the rural fishermen even if I understand the data. My friends
are "big-city" folks, my social network is dominated by people that share my
circumstances and therefore the other point-of-view doesn't find my viewfinder
often enough, weren't it for the fact that I still have family and friends
living in less ideal circumstances. It's because I know enough people on both
sides of the line that I am a bit more sensitive to the real mechanics behind
our economies.

To me, Europe feels amazing. I can move about the continent without much hassle
other than the occasional drug test which I get singled out for 8 out of 10
times[^1].

I've heard this joke a few times where blue-collars claim to produce the
wealth while it is consequently being spent in the places where the
white-collars dwell.

It is in these cities where you run into the crowds that predominantly proclaim
themselves "progressive" and "developed" were we have assigned a tinge of
negativity to the phrase "populistic", while we bear the crown of proud
democrats on our heads; often forgetting that the majority of people do not
share our circumstances. In fact, the populist agenda often represents the
views of a majority of the population and as true democrats we have to realize
that there nothing inherently good or evil about populism.

In America the term "minority" will [change definition][minority-babies] soon
enough. Populism suffers the same fate.

[^1]: Yesterday I flew from Munich to Amsterdam and noticed that in my row I
was one of the few who had to sit down to allow the gate personnel to gather
residue samples from my hands and bags for drugs or other chemical substances.
It happens all the time so I stopped being bothered about it, but I also am no
longer naive enough to believe they're completely random.

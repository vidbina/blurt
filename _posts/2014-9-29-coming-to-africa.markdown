Ever since my last [Startupbus][startupbus] experience I have promised myself 
to parttake in an event of similar impact annually. My last adventure had me 
physically exhausted but mentally empowered to the extend that it helped me drag myself 
through the whirlwind of gorgeous and horrendous experiences that I ventured
through in the year that passed.

This year I am up to the challenge again and am looking for funding just to 
spice things up this time.

## Why?
I have several reasons for wanting to join one of the African busses.
If you are here to read it here goes&hellip; (otherwise <a href="#who">tl;dr</a>)

###Homecoming
I&rsquo;ve heard so many stories about the continent where it
all began. I need to experience its glory firsthand.

###Learning
The last time I attempted a trip of this sort I learned so much
more about the world than I think I had in the year before. I spend my time on 
the trip dreaming, imagining, building solutions that could solve a problem or 
two experienced by at least two other souls on 
this planet and HH. Furthermore, seeing a bit of the world helped me to see 
things in live a bit different, which helps me in thinking out of the box.

###Giving back
I do not have dough or incredible exit stories to share, but
I do have a crapload of experience in engineering, staying lean, failing, 
getting screwed, getting hurt, rebounding, getting lucky and some other things
that may come in handy in the entrepreneurship jungle. I have been riding this
rollercoaster for a few years now {{ ":roller_coaster:" | emojify }}.

I would love to get in touch with other entrepreneurs to share my experiences.

###Connecting
Some of the great cats I have had the pleasure of connecting
with in the past year stem from my former bustrip. I relate to the misfits,
the goons, those buffoons with crazy ideas looming, with radical dreams 
blooming and a unhealthy dose of energy to tackle the challenges head-on.

###Recharging
Sleep deprivation may be one of the culprits for exhaustion, yet this very 
experience will most likely succeed in rejuvenating my mind -- it did last 
year when I coasted through Europe. You see new places, meet new people,
hear new ideas, smell new scents, hear new sounds. How can that not refuel a
brain with an unsatiable desire for more stimuli.

## How?
Well&hellip; because I know that you are such an incredibly awesome soul I
am quite convinced that you will help a jumpy geek out. I know that the 
[Ampion][ampion] gang is looking for more people (coders specifically) to join
the busses and am willing to sacrifice myself to myself to soak in that 
experience.

What is in it for you?!? The powerful idea... no the powerful fact that you
played an integral part in getting this done and turning my mood into something
that would most accurately be described as "absolutely ecstatic". Furthermore,
you will be credited for the awesome dose of energy that I will unleash unto 
this world in the aftermath of the trip.

I have several pledges that I have thought up that may interest you. The
pledges come at different costs obviously.

 - a 20 minute concert for all my pledgers. My music is a cross between jazz,
 hiphop, world music and everything else that resonates with me 
 {{ ":notes:" | emojify }}. I will spice things up with technology of course.
 My trusty computer will be on-stage composing music along with me during the
 performance (you have to see this {{ ":wink:" | emojify }}).
 - a {{ ":video_camera:" | emojify }} documentary chronicalling the experiences during my trip
 - monthly video summaries for the year after the trip to report on my 
 activities and share the progress I have been making in the projects I am 
 involved in
 - a html5-based smartphone {{ ":iphone:" | emojify }} app doing something 
 simple that you think the world or at the very least you needs to have done
 - an opportunity to unload a barrage of paintball bullets at me while I 
 volunteer to be the bunny {{ ":rabbit:" | emojify }} at a paintball 
 {{ ":gun:" | emojify }} rink. This should incentivize my enemies to pledge as 
 well. I offer an opportunity to exact revenge {{ ":rage:" | emojify }}.
 - the opportunity in naming the next gizmo I hack

<a name="who"></a>
## Who?
I code (software), I hack (hardware) and I jam (music). Because I feel that 
I am in need of a fresh batch of inspiration, I will be more than grateful to 
enjoy the opportunity to travel to the largest, and currently rapidly changing
(in terms of entrepreneurship), continent on our beloved planet {{ ":earth_africa:" | emojify }}.

It should be no surprise that I will be joining one of the busses as a coder.

Just to make things a bit easier I have sketched somewhat of a doodle of 
myself. This should hopefully give you a little picture of me.

Ever since my last [Startupbus][startupbus] experience I have promised myself 
to parttake in an event of similar impact annually. My last adventure had me 
physically exhausted but mentally empowered to the extend that it helped me drag myself 
through the whirlwind of gorgeous and horrendous experiences that I ventured
through in the year that passed.

This year I am up to the challenge again and am looking for funding just to 
spice things up this time. Quite frankly I need this boost after having gone
through one of my tougher years to date. I&rsquo;ve been around 26 years and
this was the one loaded with reality checks and oh-my-god moments. I need your 
support to not only make this the year of my deepest lows, but also that year
with one of my greatest highs. The way I see it, I still have 3 months to get 
this year balanced out.

Numerous people have recommended me to pick up music again after hearing me 
speak about my music with twinkling {{":star2:" | emojify }} eyes 
{{":eyes:" | emojify}}. Furthermore I really want to pack my bag again to 
experience new highs on a magical busride {{ ":bus:" | emojify }}. So I&rsquo;m
going to mix things up.

How about I go on that busride to get inspired to compose new tunes for your
enjoyment instead?!? {{ ":bulb:" | emojify }}.

I want to join one of the four [Ampion][ampion] busses that are set to start 
their journey somewhere in Africa in November.

## Why?
I have several reasons for wanting to join one of the African busses.
If you are here to read it here goes&hellip; (otherwise <a href="#who">tl;dr</a>)

###Homecoming
I&rsquo;ve heard enough stories about the continent where it all began. 
It&rsquo;s time to experience its glory firsthand. Being that Africa happens
to be the cradle of human life makes this a trip to my roots. Genetically the
closest match within my lineage will most likely be traceable to the west 
African region but anywhere on the continent will do for my first visit.

###Learning
The last time I attempted a trip of this sort I learned so much
more about the world than I think I had in the year before. Furthermore, seeing
a bit of the world helped me to view things in life a bit different, which 
keeps me thinking out of the box in some situations.

###Giving back
I do not have dough or incredible exit stories to share, but
I do have a crapload of experience in engineering, staying lean, failing, 
getting screwed, getting hurt, rebounding, getting lucky, making money, having
fun, losing money, giving 
200% percent and some other things that may become hallmark moments during
anyone&rsquo;s venture through the tough jungle of entrepreneurship.

I have been riding this rollercoaster for a few years now 
{{ ":roller_coaster:" | emojify }}.

It seems fun to get in touch with other entrepreneurs to share my experiences.

###Connecting
Some of the great cats I have had the pleasure of connecting
with in the past year stem from my [startupbus][startupbus] adventure last year.
I relate to the misfits, the goons, those buffoons with crazy ideas looming, 
with radical dreams blooming and a unhealthy dose of energy to tackle the 
challenges head-on. You usually meet these nut-jobs on these trips {{ ":grin:" | emojify }}.

###Recharging
Sleep deprivation may be one of the culprits for exhaustion, yet during this 
very adventure it will not obstruct the experience from rejuvenating my mind --
it didn&rsquo;t last year when I coasted through Europe.

You see new places, meet new people, hear new ideas, smell new scents, hear new 
sounds&hellip; heck, how can that not refuel a brain with an unsatiable desire
for more stimuli?!?

## How?
Well&hellip; because I know that you are such an incredibly awesome soul I
am quite convinced that you will help a jumpy geek out. I know that the 
[Ampion][ampion] gang is looking for more people (coders specifically) to join
the busses and am willing to sacrifice myself to myself to soak in that 
experience.

What is in it for you?!? The powerful idea... no the powerful fact that you
played an integral part in getting this done and turning my mood into something
that would most accurately be described as "absolutely ecstatic". Furthermore,
you will be credited for the awesome dose of energy that I will unleash unto 
this world in the aftermath of the trip.

I have several pledges that I have thought up that may interest you. The
pledges come at different costs obviously.

 - a 20 minute concert for all my pledgers. My music is a cross between jazz,
 hiphop, world music and everything else that resonates with me 
 {{ ":notes:" | emojify }}. I will spice things up with technology of course.
 My trusty computer will be on-stage composing music along with me during the
 performance (you have to see this {{ ":wink:" | emojify }}).
 - a {{ ":video_camera:" | emojify }} documentary chronicalling the experiences during my trip
 - monthly video summaries for the year after the trip to report on my 
 activities and share the progress I have been making in the projects I am 
 involved in
 - a html5-based smartphone {{ ":iphone:" | emojify }} app doing something 
 simple that you think the world or at the very least you needs to have done
 - an opportunity to unload a barrage of paintball bullets at me while I 
 volunteer to be the bunny {{ ":rabbit:" | emojify }} at a paintball 
 {{ ":gun:" | emojify }} rink. This should incentivize my enemies to pledge as 
 well. I offer an opportunity to exact revenge {{ ":rage:" | emojify }}.
 - the opportunity in naming the next gizmo I hack

<a name="who"></a>
## Who?
I code (software), I hack (hardware) and I jam (music). Because I feel that 
I am in need of a fresh batch of inspiration, I will be more than grateful to 
enjoy the opportunity to travel to the largest, and currently rapidly changing
(in terms of entrepreneurship), continent on our beloved planet {{ ":earth_africa:" | emojify }}.

It should be no surprise that I will be joining one of the busses as a coder.

Just to make things a bit easier I have sketched somewhat of a doodle of 
myself. This should hopefully give you a better picture of me {{ ":grinning:" | emojify }}.

Just to finish things up a cool song by Herbie Hancock which I recently

not giving up and I&rsquo;m imagining still&hellip;

Ever since my last startupbus experience I have promised myself to parttake in
an event of similar impact annually. My last adventure had me physically 
exhausted but mentally empowered to the extend that it helped me drag myself 
through the whirlwind of gorgeous and horrendous experiences that I ventured
through in the year that passed.

Now I have hit rock bottom (in a way) and have learned a shitload about how not
do do {{ ":shit:" | emojify }}. The promise I'm making however; is that I will
draw every lesson there is to be learned from this experience and change it all
for the better. Part of that change means believing in the possibility to make
it to Africa after all, regardless of circumstances.

## Why?
I have several reasons for wanting to join one of the African busses:

###Homecoming
I&rsquo;ve heard so many stories about the continent where it
all began. I need to experience its glory firsthand.
###Learning
The last time I attempted a trip of this sort I learned so much
more about the world than I think I had in the year before. I spend my time on 
the trip dreaming, imagining, building solutions that could solve a problem or 
two experienced by at least two other souls on 
this planet and HH. Furthermore, seeing a bit of the world helped me to see 
things in live a bit different, which helps me in thinking out of the box.
###Giving back
I do not have money or incredible exit stories to sell, but
I do have a shitload of experience in engineering, staying lean, learning from
my peers and sharing my knowledge. I would love to get in touch with some 
African entrepreneurs to share whatever I know.
###Connecting
Some of the great cats I have had the pleasure of connecting
with in the past year stem from my former bustrip. I relate to the misfits,
the goons, those buffoons with crazy ideas looming, with radical dreams 
blooming and a unhealthy dose of energy to tackle the challenge head-on.
###Recharging
The adrenaline ridden madness physically drains the body. 
Sleep deprivation is one of the culprits of the exhaustion, yet this very 
experience manages to completely rejuvenate the mind.

## How?
Well&hellip; because I know that you are such an incredibly awesome soul I
am quite convinced that you will help a hard-working brother out. I know that
the Ampion gang is looking for more people to join the busses and am willing
to sacrifice myself to myself to soak in that experience.

What is in it for you?!? The powerful idea... no the powerful fact that you
played an integral part in changing my mood from "a bit disappointed" to 
"absolutely ecstatic". Furthermore, you will be credited for the awesome dose
of energy that I will unleash unto this world in the aftermath of the trip.

I have several solid pledges that I have thought up that may interest you as
well:

 - a 20 minute concert at any venue that you arrange (it may be your home,
 your office or a accoustically remarkable auditorium)
 - a video documentary chronicalling the experiences during my trip
 - monthly video summaries for the year after the trip to report on my 
 activities and share the progress I have been making in the projects I am 
 involved in
 - a html5-based smartphone app doing something simple that you think the world
 or at the very least you needs to have done
 - an opportunity to unload a barrage of paintball bullets at me while I 
 volunteer to be the bunny at a paintball rink
 - the opportunity in naming the next gizmo I design

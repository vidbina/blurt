  Something I still need to do in 2014 to keep that insatiable hunger to
  discover and learn in balance. The nicest part is that you can help me to
  accomplish it!

I didn't make it. Didn't even get close. So yeah. That was a real bummer (which
is the only word I can think of and still abstain from profanities). I did try
so now I know how it would have worked out. What I also learned is that I
should reserve a fair amount of energy to get campaigns going if I ever try
that crowdfunding thing again. Another note... If many of your friends are
exclusively in the not-yet-funded startup hustle they will scrambling for cents
themselves.

Ever since my last [Startupbus][startupbus] experience I have promised myself
to partake in an event of similar impact annually. My last adventure had me
physically exhausted but mentally empowered to the extend that it helped me drag myself
through the whirlwind of gorgeous and horrendous experiences that I ventured
through in the year that passed.

</div>

This year I am up to the challenge again and am looking for funding just to
spice things up this time. Quite frankly I need this boost after having gone
through one of my tougher years to date. I've been around 26 years and
this was the one loaded with reality checks and oh-my-god moments. I need your
support to not only make this the year of my deepest lows, but also that year
with one of my greatest highs. The way I see it, I still have 3 months to get
this year balanced out.

Numerous people have recommended me to pick up music again after hearing me
speak about my music with twinkling :star2: eyes
:eyes:. Furthermore I really want to pack my bag again to
experience new highs on a magical bus ride :bus:. So I'm
going to mix things up.

How about I go on that bus ride to get inspired to compose new tunes for your
enjoyment instead?!? :bulb:.

I want to join one of the four [Ampion][ampion] buses that are set to start
their journey somewhere in Africa in November.

## Why?
I have several reasons for wanting to join one of the African buses. If you
are here to read it here goes... (otherwise <a href="#who">TL;DR</a>)

### Homecoming
I've heard enough stories about the continent where it all began. It's time to
experience its glory firsthand. Africa happening to be the cradle of human life
makes this a trip to my roots. Genetically the closest match within my ancestry
will lead to the west African region but anywhere on the continent will do for
my first visit.

### Learning
The last time I attempted a trip of this sort I learned so much more about the
world than I think I had in the year before. Furthermore, seeing a bit of the
world helped me to view things in life a bit different, which keeps me thinking
out of the box in some situations.

### Giving back
I do not have dough or incredible exit stories to share, but I do have a crap
load of experience in engineering, staying lean, failing, getting screwed,
getting hurt, rebounding, getting lucky, making money, having fun, losing
money, giving 200% percent and some other things that may become hallmark
moments during anyone's venture through the tough jungle of entrepreneurship.

I have been riding this roller-coaster for a few years now :roller_coaster:.

It seems fun to get in touch with other entrepreneurs to share my experiences.

### Connecting
Some of the great cats I have had the pleasure of connecting with in the past
year stem from my [startupbus][startupbus] adventure last year.  I relate to
the misfits, the goons, those buffoons with crazy ideas looming, with radical
dreams blooming and a unhealthy dose of energy to tackle the challenges
head-on. You usually meet these nut-jobs on these trips :grin:.

### Recharging
Sleep deprivation may be one of the culprits for exhaustion, yet during this
very adventure it will not obstruct the experience from rejuvenating my mind --
it didn't last year when I coasted through Europe.

You see new places, meet new people, hear new ideas, smell new scents, hear new
sounds&hellip; heck, how can that not refuel a brain with an insatiable desire
for more stimuli?!?

</div>
{% endif %}

## How?
Well&hellip; because I know that you are such an incredibly awesome soul I
am quite convinced that you will help a jumpy geek out. I know that the
[Ampion][ampion] gang is looking for more people (coders specifically) to join
the buses and am willing to sacrifice myself to myself to soak in that
experience.

What is in it for you?!? The powerful idea... No, the powerful fact that you
played an integral part in getting this done and turning my mood into something
that would most accurately be described as "absolutely ecstatic". Furthermore,
you will be credited for the awesome dose of energy that I will unleash unto
this world in the aftermath of the trip.

I have several pledges that I have thought up that may interest you. The
pledges come at different costs obviously.

 - a 20 minute concert for all my pledges. My music is a cross between jazz,
   hip hop, world music and everything else that resonates with me :notes:. I
   will spice things up with technology of course.  My trusty computer will be
   on-stage composing music along with me during the performance (you have to
   see this :wink:).
 - a :video_camera: documentary chronicling the experiences during my trip
 - monthly video summaries for the year after the trip to report on my
   activities and share the progress I have been making in the projects I am
   involved in
 - an opportunity to unload a barrage of paint ball bullets at me while I
   volunteer to be the bunny :rabbit: at a paint ball :gun: rink. This should
   incentivize my enemies to pledge as well. I offer an opportunity to exact
   revenge :rage:.
 - the opportunity in naming the next gizmo I hack
 - tickets to a few hack workshops I'm giving after I return from my trip. I'm
   working on two courses as we speak currently codenamed
   - _Hacking for Noobs_ (which should introduce you to electronics-hacking
     chops and some coding skills) and
   - _Crafting Code_ (learn how to write software).

For the courses I'm taking ideas for concepts to work into the material. So
don't hesitate to post some suggestions below. I already have a nicely planned
out batch of material to serve to you but I'd still love to get some early
input if possible.

In the year I was minted someone had a similar idea. Was only headed in the
wrong direction :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. I was actually born a few
months later to set the balance straight. For those who don't remember what
went down that year, a reminder...

## Who?
I code (software), I hack (hardware) and I jam (music). Because I feel that
I am in need of a fresh batch of inspiration, I will be more than grateful to
enjoy the opportunity to travel to the largest, and currently rapidly changing
(in terms of entrepreneurship), continent on our beloved planet :earth_africa:.

It should be no surprise that I will be joining one of the buses as a coder.

Just to make things a bit easier I have sketched somewhat of a doodle of
myself. This should hopefully give you a better picture of me :grinning:.

Let's go!

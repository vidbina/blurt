description: My experience with the German police and how I can understand the hatred that some people have against police forces.
---
It is Thursday the 22nd of October 2015 and I boarded a bus towards Munich in 
Amsterdam a night ago. There is really nothing special about it as I have
boarded buses by the same company to Berlin numerous times before. The buses
take a while to get there but if you plan your trips throughout the night, you
sleep throughout the trip and wake up at your destination while spending about
a tenth of the amount you'd generally spend on airfare or a third the amount
one would spend on train tickets. The reason I keep coming back to the buses is
the complementary Wi-Fi and the on-board power outlets which is something the
train operators haven't figured out to offer in a in a qualitative manner yet
:train:.

In Munich around 10 o'clock hell began when the police boarded the bus.
I've been raised to consider the police my friend. I understand the job they
have and the notion that they protect and serve the people. Naive as ever I
went into this experience just like that... with the police as my ally :police:.

About half an hour into the police's search through the bus after troubling a
few passengers from the Eastern or Southern part of Europe they confiscated my
passport and ordered me along with an African passenger off the bus to further
the search. Apparently they had not found what they were looking for
:confused:.

We're taken out of the bus and the police has me take off my shoes in front of
the office of Mercedes-Benz in Munich and pats me down like there is no
tomorrow. While pedestrians walk past us and bikers coast by glancing at these 
two dark-skinned guys getting patted down by the cops. There is so much wrong
with this image, because it subliminally people connect dots. After seeing a
dark-skinned man in a negative episode with the police it is not at all 
surprising that people develop some expectations about such people. After all,
they constantly see them in brushes with the law. Anyways... Every corner of my luggage is scrutinized and hardly a word is
uttered towards me as I undergo this ordeal.

At some point I am informed that my African brother and I are to enter into
the unmarked police vehicles for further processing.

Being that I am in Berlin for an appointment for possibly new work, I am
obviously frustrated as keeping another party waiting is far from professional.
However; at this time my concerns do not reflect the gravity of the situtation
I am in.

In the car I overhear the female officer say a few mean things about the
passengers in the backseat under the assumption that we don't understand a word
of German. Obviously she's wrong. With my fluency in Dutch and my late
encounters in Germany over the last few months I have picked up a fair share
of German to make sense of a conversation. This is what it feels like to get in
touch with the police?

At the station my luggage is turned upside down and I'm ordered to strip myself
entirely for a search. After finding nothing I'm let of with as little as a
"sorry". Going through an experience like this is extremely degrading.
Especially since it was quite obvious that we were singled out, being the few
dark-skinned passengers on the bus. The naive me tell himself how serious
discrimination is a thing of the past. Especially after hearing so many
Europeans boast about their progressive nature and their acceptance of
different cultures, yet I still run into painful experiences like these.

Even the conversational component is degrading. You're ordered to to as
commanded without a real alternative. The tone is off and the treatment is not
one of mutual respect. However; I kept my cool and suffered through the ordeal
without as much as an utterance from my part.

Now I'm on the bus back. I missed my second meeting because I was strapped for
time. I have the police to thank for this. Perhaps I shouldn't generalize, but
I had three officers to thank who felt like "being black" was pretty synonymous
for being a possible drug trafficker. The friendly busdrivers who I am
coincidentally being driven back by mentioned that the police was probably
tipped off by someone, so I guess I just became a victim of a tip. When I
inquired to the reason or motivation for taking me to the station the female
officer basically responded with a lousy "I smelled weed on the bus". No
canines were present but her trained nostrils were qualified enough to raise
red flags while walking through a bus from Amsterdam about the presence of
weed present or past at a location.

I still understand that the police does its job, but I'm developing a slight
hatred for the office. After a multitude of such experiences it is very easy to
imagine that the parties subjected to such treatment develop an intense hatred
for the office. I don't blame them because I felt that hatred for a brief
moment today. Especially the powerlessness is something that frustrates to
great lengths.

Tip or no tip. People don't deserved to be treated like that.

Fuck those three officers and bless the good cops on the forces :cop:.

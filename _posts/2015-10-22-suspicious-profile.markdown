description: My experience with the German police and how I can understand the hatred that some people have against police forces.
emojify: true

It is Thursday the 22nd of October 2015 and I boarded a bus towards Munich in
Amsterdam a night ago. I planned to visit two prospective clients to discover
to which extent I could aid in their efforts by offering my hardware and
software engineering services. There is really nothing special about such trips
as I have boarded buses by the same company to Berlin numerous times before.
The buses take a while to get there but if you plan your trips throughout the
night, you sleep throughout the trip and wake up at your destination while
spending about a tenth of the amount you'd generally spend on airfare or a
third the amount one would spend on train tickets. The reason I keep using the
buses is the complementary Wi-Fi and the on-board power outlets which is
something the train operators haven't figured out to offer in a in a
qualitative manner yet :train:. To be quite honest, I also haven't developed
the luxury demand yet that makes long-distance travel by bus unbearable
:stuck_out_tongue:.

In Munich :de:, around 10 o'clock :clock10:, the police boarded the bus for
another one of those "random" checks. I've been raised to consider the police
my friend. I understand the notion of them being in office to protect and
serve the people and I have felt comfortable in the presence of the law as long
as I can remember. Naive as ever I went into this experience just like that...
with the police as my ally.

About half an hour into the police's search through the bus, after having
singled out a few passengers from the Eastern or Southern part of Europe and
having confiscated my passport along with that of a most likely African
passenger, the officers ordered me and the other dark-skinned passenger off the
bus. Apparently they had not found what they were looking for and seemed quite
determined to make a bust :confused:. While packing up my belongings to exit
the bus, the female officer rummages through my belongings and accidentally
drops my Macbook Air, picks it up and tells me it is alright. For a split
second my mind races to the hell I'll have to venture through if the laptop
ends up defective and I would have to setup a new laptop with all of my build
environments and rewrite all the uncommitted code on my trusty old pal. I would
end up losing days installing all of my tools -- Jeez! Obviously I take her
word for it because she must be an expert in assessing the state of electronic
devices as she is also an expect in singling out which rows
on buses from Amsterdam "smell like they hosts weed-trafficking passengers"
:unamused:. God forbid I talk back to a police officer.

</div>

We're taken out of the bus and the officers help themselves to a power trip
by having me take off my shoes in front of the wonderful offices of
Mercedes-Benz and Ernst and Young in Munich while they rummage through my
personal belongings for a second time. Pedestrians walk past and gawk at the
display and bikers coast by glancing at the theatrics involving the police and
a few richly colored gentlemen. There is so much wrong with this image and how
subliminally dots are being connected but I am no authority in psychology and
neuroscience so I abstain from further comments.

</div>

The funny thing is that I haven't once been involved in any offense but at
this moment it sure doesn't feel like I'm a law-abiding citizen. That probably
isn't the intent of such operations, but it does reflect the result. Every
corner of my luggage is scrutinized and hardly a word is uttered towards me as
I undergo this ordeal. I don't feel like a respected citizen of the European
Union at all. I don't feel protected, by the people that are there to protect
and serve.

At some point I am informed that my African brother and I are to enter the
unmarked police vehicles for further processing at the precinct based on
the female officer's keen sense of smell. Obviously this team is so skilled at
pinpointing targets by aroma that canines :dog: aren't consulted, as a matter
of fact they are nowhere near the scene, yet I can't help but believe that
man's best friend is a better skilled and more reliable "sniffer".

Considering I am in Munich for a few appointments for new work, I am obviously
not amused as keeping those parties waiting is not going to help me in
achieving that objective (of scoring new work), however; unbeknown to me my
concerns at the moment do not reflect the gravity of the situation I am in.

In the car I overhear the female officer say  a few demeaning things about the
dear passengers in the backseat while driving towards the station under the
assumption that we don't understand a word of German. With my fluency in Dutch,
a Germanic language that I consider my mother tongue, and my late encounters in
Germany over the last few months I have picked up a fair share of German to
make sense of this conversation, but I keep myself composed. This is what it
feels like to get in touch with the police? Unidirectional respect?

At the station my luggage is turned upside down yet again and I'm patted down
like there is no tomorrow. Nothing turned up. At this stage I am ordered to
undo myself of my clothing. The police hasn't taken any real effort to engage
in a dialog to discover my reasons for visiting Munich. After finding nothing
after putting me through a demeaning experience I'm let of with as little as a
"sorry". Going through an experience like this happened to be sufficiently
degrading to make me never want to have an encounter with the our friends at
the police ever again.

There I stand, in front of the precinct quite a distance removed from the
station that I bought my ticket to, left to figure out alternative means of
getting to my destination. The police doesn't even have the courtesy to at the
very least offer me a drive back to the location where they ordered me to
enter their vehicles after such a horrible experience.

Especially since it was rather obvious that we were singled out, being the few
richly colored passengers on the bus, I have come to realize even more that
the world isn't as accepting as we sometimes portray it to be. Better put...
The civilized west isn't as progressive and enlightened as it portrays itself
to be if such experiences are to be considered acceptable.

Even the conversational component is disappointing. You're ordered to do as
commanded without a real alternative. The tone is off and the treatment is not
one of mutual respect. However; I kept my cool and suffered through the ordeal
without as much as an utterance from my part.

Now I'm on the bus back. I missed my second meeting because I was strapped for
time and I have my friends at the police to thank for this. Perhaps I shouldn't
generalize, I had three officers to thank who made an educated guess that there
was a high probability of me turning up a trafficker. As far as educated
guesses go this one ended up as useful as a random pick by a blind baboon would
have been. The friendly bus drivers who are coincidentally driving me back to
Amsterdam at night mentioned that the police was probably tipped off which could
mean that I just became a victim of an anonymous tip. When I inquired to the
reason or motivation for taking me to the station the female officer basically
responded with a lousy "I smelled weed on the bus". So much for
_probable cause_ because it is so rare to pick up a remote hint of cannabis on a
bus from Amsterdam. No canines were present but her olfactoric finesse was
sufficient to raise red flags about the presence of weed in the present or
past at any location in a bus from Amsterdam.

I still understand that the police does its job, but during the experience I
felt an intense hatred for the office. After a multitude of such experiences it
isn't far-fetched to imagine that the parties subjected to such treatment develop
an enduring hatred for the office and everything associated to it. I guess the
idea of being powerless is one of the many frustrating things about this
ordeal. Can I blame people for disliking the police if many of their
experiences are as negative as the one I've had and probably often even worse
[^1]?

I often marginalized the impact of discrimination and treatment by the police,
but I just realized that **I do not have the right** to blatantly broadcast
any utterances pertaining such topics until I have been through a comparable
experience. Many of my not so richly colored friends feel differently about
some of these topics because they hardly run into experiences like these --
not at the frequency that different looking folks endure such experiences. Then
again everyone experiences things that are rather unique to whatever groups
they belong to so at some point we are all probably subjected to discrimination
of some form. Anyways... One cannot possibly be expected to fully understand the
gravity of that which their richly colored peers experience if they cannot
relate to it. I'll do you one better... I, as one of those richly colored folks,
cannot relate to the many experiences that I hear from others that share my
complexion which means that I don't even come close to fully understanding the
plight of the colored in the West. Although I experience discrimination in
many different forms. I brush it off and move on. I believe it keeps me from
becoming bitter and cynical about the world, but I am also slowly realizing
that ignoring reality is unfair as well since it harms objective
interpretation.

The once carefree David is now cautious and on guard in some situations, a
natural response when in a rather hostile environment but a sad place to have
to venture to for any human living in a self-proclaimed enlightened part of the
world.


[^1]: Let's face it. It was demeaning but it wasn't a cavity search yet, so I guess the experience could have been far more degrading.

In the end this post isn't just about discrimination. The point here is that
many events influence us in manners unimaginable to others. Nobody should have
the audacity to tell anyone of semitic heritage to get over the 1940s because
we have no idea how this event has rippled into the lives of many fellow
humans who may be hurting to this day. I can't tell any of my friends to get
over that historic episode for that little country where a coup was followed by
turmoil and political assassinations spearheaded by this charismatic leader, as
I have no way of totally understanding the impact those events had on my friend
and his family when they discovered that the murder of beloved father was
connected to this episode and the people involved. I have no right to tell my
black friends to brush of that Dutch tradition, cherished by millions of
children (and adults), in which some characters appear in what some believe to
be black face as just an innocent celebration because I haven't been called out
for [zwarte piet][zp] like my brother has and even if I had, the tone and
context may have been different enough to change reception altogether. I don't
have the right to tell a zealot that my fierce comments shouldn't phase him or
her because I don't fully understand how it impacts him.
Understanding is the name of the game. Just live and let live.

I would like to remind everyone to seriously consider the impact of one's
treatment of fellow human beings as it is too easy to ignore the destructive
impact that some of our actions and utterances have. The world can use a
lot more love and understanding -- especially if you have been appointed to
serve in a public office and therefore represent something bigger than any one
person.

Think about that.

description: My experience with the German police and how I can understand the hatred that some people have against police forces.
---
It is Thursday the 22nd of October 2015 and I boarded a bus towards Munich in 
Amsterdam a night ago. I planned to visit two prospective clients to discover
to which extent I could aid in their efforts by offering my hardware and
software engineering services. There is really nothing special about such trips
as I have boarded buses by the same company to Berlin numerous times before.
The buses take a while to get there but if you plan your trips throughout the
night, you sleep throughout the trip and wake up at your destination while
spending about a tenth of the amount you'd generally spend on airfare or a
third the amount one would spend on train tickets. The reason I keep using the
buses is the complementary Wi-Fi and the on-board power outlets which is
something the train operators haven't figured out to offer in a in a
qualitative manner yet :train:. To be quite honest, I also haven't developed
the luxury demand yet that makes long-distance travel by bus unbearable
:stuck_out_tongue:.

In Munich :de: around 10 o'clock :clock10: the police boarded the bus for
another one of those "random" checks. I've been raised to consider the police
my friend. I understand the notion of them being in office to protect and
serve the people and I have felt comfortable in the presence of the law as long
as I can remember. Naive as ever I went into this experience just like that...
with the police as my ally.

About half an hour into the police's search through the bus, after having
singled out a few passengers from the Eastern or Southern part of Europe and
having confiscated my passport along with that of a most likely African
passenger, the officers ordered me and the other dark-skinned passenger off the
bus. Apparently they had not found what they were looking for and seemed quite
determined to make a bust :confused:. While packing up my belongings to exit
the bus, the female officer runs through my belongings and accidentally drops
my Macbook Air, picks it up and tells me it is alright. Obviously I take her
word for it because she must be an expert in assessing the state of electronic
devices as she is also an expect in singling out which rows on buses from
Amsterdam "smells like they hosts weed-trafficking passengers :unamused:.

We're taken out of the bus and the officers help themselves to a power trip
by having me take off my shoes in front of the office of Mercedes-Benz in
Munich while rummaging through my personal belongings for a second time.
Pedestrians walk past and gawk at the display and bikers coast by glancing at
the theatric involving the police and a few richly colored fellows. There is
so much wrong with this image and how subliminally dots are connected but I am
no authority in psychology and neuroscience so I abstain from further comments.

The funny thing is that I haven't once been involved with any offense but at
this moment it sure doesn't feel like I'm a law-abiding citizen. Every corner
of my luggage is scrutinized and hardly a word is uttered towards me as I
undergo this ordeal. I don't feel like a respected citizen of the European
Union at all. I don't feel protected, by the people that are there to protect
and serve..

At some point I am informed that my African brother and I are to enter into
the unmarked police vehicles for further processing at the precinct based on
the female officers keen sense of smell. Obviously this team is so skilled at
pinpointing targets by aroma that canines :dog: aren't consulted, as a matter
of fact they are nowhere near the scene, yet I can't help but believe that they
are the better skilled and more reliable "sniffers".

Considering I am in Munich for a few appointments for new work, I am obviously
not amused as keeping another party waiting is not going to help me in
achieving that objective, however; unbeknown to me my concerns at the moment
do not reflect the gravity of the situation I am in.

In the car I overhear the female officer while driving says a few demeaning
things about the passengers in the backseat under the assumption that we don't
understand a word of German. With my fluency in Dutch, a Germanic language that
I consider my mother tongue, and my late encounters in Germany over the last
few months I have picked up a fair share of German to make sense of a
conversation, but I keep myself composed. This is what it feels like to get in
touch with the police?

At the station my luggage is turned upside down yet again and I'm patted down
like there is no tomorrow. Nothing turned up. At this stage I am ordered to
take all of my clothes off. The police hasn't taken any real effort to engage
in a dialog to discover my reasons for visiting Munich. After finding nothing
after putting me through a demeaning experience I'm let of with as little as a
"sorry". Going through an experience like this happened to be sufficiently degrading, to make me never
want to have an encounter with the police again. There I stand. In front of
the precinct far away from the station that I bought my ticket to, left to
figure out alternative means of getting to my destination. The police don't
even have the customer to offer to drive a citizen of the EU to at least the
location where they ordered me to enter their vehicles after such a horrible
experience.

Especially since it was rather obvious that we were singled out, being the few
richly colored passengers on the bus, I have come to realize even more that
the world isn't as accepting as we sometimes portray it to be. Better put...
The civilized west isn't as progressive and enlightened as it portrays itself
to be if such experiences are normal.

Even the conversational component is disappointing. You're ordered to do as
commanded without a real alternative. The tone is off and the treatment is not
one of mutual respect. However; I kept my cool and suffered through the ordeal
without as much as an utterance from my part.

Now I'm on the bus back. I missed my second meeting because I was strapped for
time and I have my friends at the police to thank for this. Perhaps I shouldn't
generalize, I had three officers to thank who made an educated guess that I
had a high chance of turning up a trafficking. The friendly bus drivers who are
coincidentally driving me back to Amsterdam mentioned that the police was
probably tipped off by someone, so I guess I just became a victim of a tip.
When I inquired to the reason or motivation for taking me to the station the
female officer basically responded with a lousy "I smelled weed on the bus". So
much for _probable cause_. No canines were present but her olfactoric finesse
were developed enough to raise red flags while walking through a bus from
Amsterdam about the presence of weed present or past at a location.

I still understand that the police does its job, but during the experience I
felt an intense hatred for the office. After a multitude of such experiences it
isn't far-fetched to imagine that the parties subjected to such treatment develop
an enduring hatred for the office and everything associated to it. I guess the
idea of being powerless is one of the many very frustrating things about this
ordeal. Can I blame people for disliking the police if many of their
experiences are as negative as the one I've had and probably often even worse
[^1]?

I often marginalized the impact of discrimination and treatment by the police,
but I just realized that **I do not have the right** to blatantly broadcast
any utterances pertaining such topics until I have been through a comparable
experience. Many of my not so richly colored friends feel differently about
some of these topics because they hardly run into experiences like these --
not at the frequency that different looking folks endure such experiences. Then
again everyone experiences things that are rather unique to whatever groups
they belong to so at some point we are all subjected to discrimination of some
form. Anyways... One cannot possibly be expected to fully understand the
gravity of that which their richly colored peers experience if they cannot
relate to it. I'll do you one better... I ask a richly colored person cannot
relate to the many experiences that I hear from others that share my
complexion which means that I don't even come close to understanding the
plight of some of similarly complexioned fellow humans. Although I experience 
discrimination in many different forms. I brush it off and move on. I believe
it keeps me from becoming bitter and cynical about the world, but I am also
slowly realizing that ignoring reality is unfair as well since it harms
objective interpretation.

The once carefree David is now cautious and on guard in some situations, a
natural response when in a rather hostile environment but a sad place to have
to venture to for any human living in a self-proclaimed enlightened part of the
world.


[^1]: Let's face it. It was demeaning but it wasn't a cavity search yet, so I guess the experience could have been far more degrading.

I would like to remind everyone to seriously consider the impact of one's
treatment of fellow human beings as it is too easy to ignore the destructive
impact that some of our actions and utterances have. The world can use a
lot more love and understanding -- especially if you have been appointed to
serve in a public office and represent something bigger than any one person.

Think about that.

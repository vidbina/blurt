  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>As a kid in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suriname">Suriname</a>
  I spend my time tinkering with electronics, doing chores I didn't like
  (didn't like gardening back then), reading and playing&mdash;off course (I
  was a reasonably normal kid :wink:).
  I taught myself how to program computers through trial-and-error and the 
  built-in help feature first when learning 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBASIC</a> and later through
  online tutorials and hardcover books that my father had in his collection.
  Apparently during his economics studies during the 80's in The Netherlands,
  they also received some programming courses in C and C++ which explained him
  buying the books. The tutorials, I would download from the internet when my
  parents weren't home. I had my system of quickly dialing-in to the web
  and crawling as much pages as possible for offline access :wink:
  and other than a few unexplained surges in the 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access">dial-up</a>
  bills no one has noticed a thing.</p>

  <p>My father would always remind me not to wreck his computer around those 
  days, because it also served as his office computer. This prevented me from 
  going crazy on the box. Motivated to have my own machine, I saved up some
  cash and bought my pop's old computer which opened up the road to 
  limitless experimentation and unbounded learning for me. Some of my unbounded 
  learning involved me writing a basic 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub7">Sub7</a>-like application in
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic">Visual Basic</a>
  that I sent to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ">ICQ</a> buddies
  to take some control of their computers, because security was a joke back
  then :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :unlock:
  </p>
  <!--I wrote a rudimentary sub7-ish application in Visual Basic that I sent to my ICQ buddies-->

  <p>By the time I finished high-school I had to choose what to study. Computer 
  sciences did seem interesting, but I figured I could learn that from books
  :books: and brain-picking (provided I had the right people around me).
  Electronics, on the other hand, often required access to some equipment I
  couldn't readily get my hands on because of the financial situation. That is
  why I studied electronics which opened up the world of grade-A workspaces.
  Besides just understanding software, I wanted to be able to master hardware
  as well which would give me the proper bird-eye view of the playing field.</p>

  <p>I did study electronics, which marked a wonderful time in my life. After 
  graduating I set foot in the <em>real world</em> by beginning my free-lancing
  adventures. I have built plenty of cool products, made stupid mistakes (lessons), 
  got punked, got amazed, discovered more of my strengths and weaknesses and am
  learning truck-loads of new things through it all on a daily basis. 

  I am also <strong>having a blast!</strong> on sunny :sunny: and rainy 
  :umbrella: days&mdash;where other people just go to work, I head to the
  playgrounds (what I call my office) and I'm set on keeping that 
  energy and sense of wonder intact.</p>

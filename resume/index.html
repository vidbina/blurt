  <h2>About Myself</h2>
  <p>As a kid I spend my time tinkering with electronics, doing chores I didn't
  like and playing... off course {{ ":wink:" | emojify }}. I taught myself how 
  to program computers through online tutorials and books that my pops had lying 
  around the house. Apparently during his economics studies in the 80's, they 
  also received some programming courses in C and C++ because I found those 
  books in his collection. The internet tutorials I would download from the 
  internet when my parents weren't home. I would quickly dial-in to the web
  and download whatever I could process in a week and quickly log off. Pops and
  moms never caught me in action {{ ":smile:" | emojify }}.</p>

  <p>My father would always remind me not to wreck the computer when I was 
  still using his', because it also served as his work machine, which prevented 
  me from going crazy on the box. After buying my father's old computer with 
  some hard-earned cash I started hacking without limitations. By the time I 
  finished high-school I had to choose what to study. Computer sciences did 
  seem interesting, but I figured I could learn that from books and 
  brain-picking. Electronics, on the other hand, often required access to some 
  tools and equipment I couldn't get my hands on because of the financial 
  aspect. That is why I studied electronics. I wanted to be able 
  to program computers, build robots and rule my universe in the way I deemed 
  appropriate.</p>

  <p>I did study electronics. T'was a wonderful time. After graduating I set
  foot in the <em>real world</em> by beginning my free-lancing adventures. 
  I have built plenty of cool products, made stupid mistakes (lessons), 
  discovered more of my strengths and weaknesses and am learning truck-loads 
  of new things through it all. 
  Most importantly, however; <strong>I am having a blast!</strong>
  On sunny {{ ":sunny:" | emojify }} and rainy {{ ":umbrella:" | emojify }} 
  days.</p>

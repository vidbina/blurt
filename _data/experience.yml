    By the time I joined Freewayworks LLC, the company was on the verge of
    joining a incubation program to aid in bringing the concept to the public.
    In my three months with the company I asked many of the critical questions,
    helped us steer clear of unnecessary busy work by focussing on that will
    leads to results quickly (which equates to lessons to be learned) and built
    whatever was necessary to (in)validate the assumptions we still had at that
    stage.

    In an effort to anticipate to future developments Vita.io needed her
    infrastructure prepared for the upcoming demands (larger dev teams, more
    customers). In this case I assisted in the attempts to explore the options
    in moving away from a few virtual private servers towards a cloud-based
    solution that has the required reduncancy and offers the necessary
    flexibility in required workload. I have been chosen to set up the new
    infrastructure to help the company move forward.

  During the course of the program I parttook in the development of robots,

  university. I spent many sleepless nights getting up to speed in my 
  subjects to keep up with my peers. It was quite a struggle, but I kept 
  pushing. After a chat with the dean, I discovered that I should not have 
  been admitted with my HAVO diploma (they explained that the American high 
  school program compares to the Dutch HAVO program).
  <br/>In The Netherlands, 
  WO universities require students to have a VWO diploma or at least a 
  Propedeuse (completion of the freshman year) from an accredited HBO 
  university prior to joining a WO university program. At this point I started 
  looking for a HBO university (hogeschool) in order to obtain my Propedeuse. 
  <br/>
  I was not well aware of this difference when I signed up for the program 
  whilst in Suriname, but now I know that the Dutch educational system is a bit
  more layered then the American system, which I'm more acquainted with."

    Heading an engineering firm focussed on helping firms develop tech
    solutions that leverage blockchain technology, cloud computing or IoT.
    With a distributed team of engineer, we take on the development of
    electronic devices including the circuit design and firmware development.
    Furthermore, we have helped several companies build their cloud
    infrastructure from scratch or upgrade their infrastructure to facilitate
    growth. Occasionally, we have jumped in to help companies fix front-end
    applications or smartphone apps although that doesn't necessarily represent
    our core focus. All in all -- the team is comprised of a rather versatile
    set of engineers and has succeeded in tackling a variety of engineering
    problems.

    Joined the company when there were only architects on the engineering team
    and helped out with the recruiting of a engineering team, the development
    of the first services and the architecting of the overall architecture for
    the system we were working towards. With regards to the development part of
    my contributions, the focus was on producing the software to be used in
    relaying communications from our cloud environment to the industrial
    computers that controlled the assets of interest (battery banks) within a
    network with numerous safeguards to complicate unwanted access (as mandated
    by German regulations as this pertained to an infrastructure project and
    therefore was subjected to the necessary requirements to safeguard national
    security) and accessed through an unreliable network (GPRS link).

    company we spent a predominant amount of our time on customer development
    and testing while a smaller portion was spent on refining prototypes in

  university. I spent many sleepless nights getting up to speed in my 
  subjects to keep up with my peers. It was quite a struggle, but I kept 
  pushing. After a chat with the dean, I discovered that I should not have 
  been admitted with my HAVO diploma (they explained that the American high 
  school program compares to the Dutch HAVO program).
  <br/>In The Netherlands, 
  WO universities require students to have a VWO diploma or at least a 
  Propedeuse (completion of the freshman year) from an accredited HBO 
  university prior to joining a WO university program. At this point I started 
  looking for a HBO university (hogeschool) in order to obtain my Propedeuse. 
  <br/>
  I was not well aware of this difference when I signed up for the program 
  whilst in Suriname, but now I know that the Dutch educational system is a bit
  more layered then the American system, which I'm more acquainted with."

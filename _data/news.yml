    Some winners of the TNW hackathon in the Spring of 2015 in anticipation of
    the TNW Conference in NYC. My humble contribution had the privilege of
    being deemed worthy of some recognition by the Todoist team. That is how I
    got my lifetime Todoist subscription.

  title: "Tech Diversity: Accelerators Go After Women, Underrepresented Minorities For New Startup Ideas"

    Not about me, just about accellerators that are attempting to get more
    members of "minority" groups involved. Somehow, a photo with my mug on it
    got selected to picture what we're talking about when we say "minority".
    I take this as a compliment, glad to represent whichever "minority" group
    some may classify me as and continue to help break frontiers by doing
    whatever I do. Often I'm the only "black" guy at a meet up or conference;
    sometimes I'm one of a select few and we acknowledge each other's presence
    by a friendly nod; one day I'll just blend in as one of the many -- the day
    that no one will notice the black guy because that isn't a statistic
    highlight anymore.

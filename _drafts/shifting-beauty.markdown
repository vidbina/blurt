description: A wonderfull observation made during one of my encounters with the binary sort.
---
I have frequently had to calculate with binary numbers but this time I did 
notice something quite different. Something that is already well known to the
rest of the world but managed to capture my attention because of its elegance.

    0001 0100 = 20
    0000 1010 = 10
    0000 0101 =  5
    0000 0010 =  2     .1    = 1/2           = 5/2
    0000 0001 =  1     .01   = 1/4           = 5/4
    0000 0000 =  0     .101  = 5/8  = .625   = 5/8
    0000 0000 =  0     .0101 = 5/16 = .3125  = 5/16

    200000 =  65536
    020000 =   8192
    002000 =   1024
    000200 =    128
    000020 =     16
    000002 =      2
    000000 =      0    .2    = 2/8
    000000 020000 =    .02   = 2/64  .03

I believe I don't slow down frequently enough to admire the beauty of things.

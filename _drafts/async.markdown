title: Asyncronous Confusion
description: Deep-diving into the world of asyncronous computing for a better understanding

Lately I have had a few brazen encounters with different programming styles and
paradigms. None of which are new under the sun. Thanks to my startup adventures
and my insatiable desire to be exposed to the newest {{ ":shit:" | emojify }},
I do occasionally find myself submerged in material I hardly master well 
enough&hellip; which is bad, M&rsquo;kay?!?

In order to master the dark art of asyncronous processing I have decided to
conduct a small study and write a few experiments, comparing synchronously
computed code vs asynchronous equivalents. This experiment should help
in strengthening whatever &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; I convinced myself to 
have &dash; learning by doing. Zed Shaw&rsquo;s title jumps to mind as the perfect
credo to this episode&hellip; Programming motherfucker {{ ":metal:" | emojify }}

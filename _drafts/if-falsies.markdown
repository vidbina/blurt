description: A simpleton's reasoning of if/then logic in case of false hits

After a inspiring dinner with the founder of Clinck, I've just resumed my 
week's reading. I'm covering math... the basics... conditional statements.

Fairly quickly I stumble upon the `if false` cases which always appear to be
true. Why's that?

## Perception
It is not about the output, but about the truthfulness of the statement. 
Constantly ask yourself, is the statement true?

if creature has green blood, then the creature is an alien
$p$ has green blood
$q$ is an alien

if creature has green blood and the creature happens to be an alien the 
statement is clearly true.

if creature has green blood, but somehow does not happen to be classified as an
alien (perhaps some mutant venturing through Gotham) then the statement is
blatantly false.

if the creature has pink blood and happens to be an alien, the statement is
true because we only said something about the green critters which can not be
discredited by this observation.

if the creature has pink blood and does not happen to be an alien, the 
statement is still true because yet again our statement only said something
about the green-blooded.

basically only the cases where the first condition happens to be true are truly
evaluated. Everything else is simply a don't care.

  Just a run-down of my favorite XMonad layouts and hopefully a decent
  note-to-self to help me remember the finer details of them at some
  later stage.

## MultiColumns

[MultiColumns](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib-0.13/docs/XMonad-Layout-MultiColumns.html)
provide a great way to keep your windows in check. The documentation is rather
clear on how they work, although I've been slightly puzzled about the operation
of them when I initially started using XMonad.

The document presents a setup that reads as follows:

```haskell
multiCol [1] 4 0.01 0.5
```

which results to a single window in the main column, a maximum of 4 windows per
subsequent column with a step size of of 0.01 for every resize change with an
initial master pane size of 0.5 the screen width.

The [XMonad tour](http://xmonad.org/tour.html) gives a good introduction to the
XMonad basics. In short, the layout can be modified using some of the default
keybindings. If you haven't changed the [default keybindings](https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad/blob/3897cab7c9b708446a4a6f6bb2918a3c07c31f08/src/XMonad/Config.hs#L185), resizing of
the width of the windows is simply altered by sending the `Shrink` message
(Mod+H) and the `Expand` message (Mod+L), while one can increment the number of
windows per column throught sending the `(IncMasterN 1)` message (Mod+comma)
and decrement through sending the `(IncMasterN (-1))` message (Mod+,).

Simply this arrangement of tools suffices in composing a vast array of layouts.

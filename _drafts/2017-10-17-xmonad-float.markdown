When using XMonad you will want to float some windows such as dialogs and
prompts by default. XMonad allows for the use of the window class and titles,
among other properties to achieve this.

Run `xprop` from the terminal and click on any window that one may want to
float by default. Upon clicking the window of interest some attributes of the
clicked window will be printed as the output of xprop.

```
WM_STATE(WM_STATE):
                window state: Normal
                icon window: 0x0
_NET_WM_PID(CARDINAL) = 2143
WM_PROTOCOLS(ATOM): protocols  WM_DELETE_WINDOW, _NET_WM_PING
WM_LOCALE_NAME(STRING) = "en_US.UTF-8"
WM_CLASS(STRING) = "urxvt", "URxvt"
WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
                Client accepts input or input focus: True
                Initial state is Normal State.
                window id # of group leader: 0x1200006
WM_NORMAL_HINTS(WM_SIZE_HINTS):
                program specified minimum size: 15 by 29
                program specified resize increment: 15 by 29
                program specified base size: 0 by 0
                window gravity: NorthWest
WM_CLIENT_MACHINE(STRING) = "bina.me"
WM_COMMAND(STRING) = { "urxvt" }
_NET_WM_ICON_NAME(UTF8_STRING) = "urxvt"
WM_ICON_NAME(STRING) = "urxvt"
_NET_WM_NAME(UTF8_STRING) = "urxvt"
WM_NAME(STRING) = "urxvt"
```

In my case I simply need windows of the "Pinentry" class to always float which
may be accomplished by setting up a `manageHook` in XMonad.

```haskell
myManageHook = composeAll [
  className =? "Pinentry" --> doFloat
]
```

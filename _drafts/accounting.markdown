When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

Here goes "{{ page.mathjax }}" \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\)

## Polarity
Accountants have this credit/debit mumbo-jumbo that has been a cause of the
doubts I've had lately regarding my intellect. I just couldn't wrap my
mind around it until the great Rob explained it to me.

The accountants lingo is kinda screwed up for a simpleton like me. So let us
talk about <strong>growth</strong> and <strong>decrease</strong> instead.

## Accounts
Assume that we have five accounts named:

 - assets
 - liabilities
 - income
 - expenses
 - equity

Our company needs a small hadron collider, we really do. Giving this gadget 
a place in our financial records would demand the following:

 - a note of the expense made for the collider
 - a note of the newly acquired asset

The idea is quite simple. We take some <strong>money out of our bank</strong> 
account (which is an asset account) and write up an asset <strong>addition to 
the lab assets</strong> account. 

<blockquote>
A withdrawal on a asset account would be entered as a credit entry, conversely 
an addition to an asset account should be entered as a debit entry.
</blockquote>

### Asserts, Liability, Income, Expense, Equity

I've heard this song a while ago, but everytime I hear it my mind goes racing.
In the end this exercise may almost be deemed futile by many as it falls into 
the category of the dreaded &ldquo;what if&rdquo; questions that don't do much
other than serve as food for thought and fuel for the dreams composed while we
drift through the layers of the multiverse during our nightly recharge 
sessions.

description: The road I ventured from concept to almost first-shipment, basically the tale of how we got Laundr up and running.

I believe it has been a month and a half since this idea has been floating 
around in the start-up space. Orgeon came up with it, got the Saddle fellers 
all too much excited about the concept and that is how the ball started rolling.


## The short version
This is the short version of the story

 - Orgeon starts getting people excited about the story
 - Saddle joins in on the excitement
 - The ,now Laundr fellers, start talking with people about the idea
 - The Laundr fellers get tailors excited and willing to eventually join

description: Rehashing basic Matrix math

I'm rehashing some old math knowledge because I'm aching to get jump into the
world of game development, but also because I've taken some interest into
Kinematics, being taught in a Autonomous Mobile Robots class at EdX.

## Vectrices
### Dot-Products
If $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are both $N$-dimensional vectors with 
elements denoted as $\\langle a\_{1}, a\_{2}, \\cdots, a\_{N}\\rangle$ and 
$\\langle b\_{1}, b\_{2}, \\cdots, b\_{N}\\rangle$ respectively, the 
dot-product of the two vectors would result to the sum of the products of 
elements at the same place within the two vectors (e.g.: the product of the 
first elements of vector $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ plus the product of 
the second elements of vector $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, etc).

\\(
  \\mathbf{a} \cdot \\mathbf{b} = 
  \\langle a\_{1}, a\_{2}, \\cdots, a\_{N}\\rangle 
    \cdot 
    \\langle b\_{1}, b\_{2}, \\cdots, b\_{N} \\rangle
\\)

\\(
  \\mathbf{a} \cdot \\mathbf{b} = 
  a\_{1}b\_{1} + a\_{2}b\_{2} + \cdots + a\_{N}b\_{N} 
\\)

The output of the dot product always results in  a scalar, which is why
it is often referred to as the _scalar product_ of two vectors.

Formally a dot product is described as the 
\\(
  \\mathbf{a} \cdot \\mathbf{b} = 
  |\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|\cos{\theta}
\\)

### Cross-Product

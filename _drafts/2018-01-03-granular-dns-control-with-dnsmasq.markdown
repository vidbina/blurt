The /etc/dnsmasq-\*.conf files are managed by by resolvconf. In some cases
connecting to WiFI networks and then subsequently up-ing a VPN connection
may result to a DNS configuration that defaults to the non-VPN DNS servers
first. This could be a problem since, depending on the region, the DNS
servers for a given provider may take precedence over your VPN's DNS
servers.

For example, when I'm on a ziggo.nl network in The Netherlands, a website
like thepiratebay.org has been block by court-order. Any attempt to access
thepiratebay.org will lead to a page notifying the user of the court
mandated DNS listing.

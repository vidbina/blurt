Yesterday, a bit of config hacking with Lassulus at c-base, resulted to a bunch
of new ideas that I would like to implement. In short, I would like to mimick
one specific feature that I remember from my Alfred usage days on OSX on my
Linux setup. Think about typing mathmatical expressions and getting the answers
presented through popups or notifications, for starters. Perhaps even copying it
to the clipboard right away, or at least allowing the user to click the
notification or a button on a notification to perform the copy operation.

So this post documents my journey and learnings in my attempts to solve this
issue.

At this stage I had already installed notify-osd on my NixOS :snowflake: mech
before. Puzzled by notify-osd automatically starting after me logging in,
without any reference to it in any of the services or dotfiles I wrote led me
down a little investigation into the suspected culprits. :confused:.

A grep on the Nixpkgs codebase indicates that there is merely a package defined
for notify-osd, that provides a "wrapped" binary and nothing more -- no
services or additions to startup scripts or dotfiles.

Furthermore, I found no services mentioning notify-osd and not a single
reference in any of my existing dotfiles.

WTF is starting notify-osd? :confused:

The output of `pstree` after a fresh reboot displays `notify-osd` just one
level under the init system (`systemd`), which would leave one to assume
that either systemd sparked the process (and perhaps manages it too) or
something else triggered a start of notify-osd. Since it isn't forked under
another application that could provide clues as to what started it, I still
have to look elsewhere for answers.

```

At this stage I recalled noticing a notify-osd popup every time I connected to
a network leading me to assume that NetworkManager may have something to do with
starting notify-osd. Since PID's tend increase with time as new processes are
started, the pstree listing suggests that the network manager (PID: 1017) along
with my bluetooth daemons (PID: 1699) and some other junk were started before
notify-osd.

In order to explore the hunch that NetworkManager may be involved, I kill
notify-osd and reconnect to a network and voilà... notify-osd is ressurected.

Recalling reading something about D-Bus in conjunction NetworkManager far in
the past, I decide to finally dive into a long overdue encounter with D-Bus to
get to the bottom of this.

# D-Bus

The [DBus][dbus] homepage, under the section __What is D-Bus__, reads:

> D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a "single instance" application or daemon, and to **launch applications and daemons on demand** when their services are needed.

The D-Bus (Desktop bus) ecosystem introduces the concept of busses,
connections, objects, interfaces and members.

<div class="element svg light">
  <img src="/svg/diagrams/dbus-ecosystem-overview.svg" alt="D-Bus facilitates connections that host objects that expose methods. A user of D-Bus connects to the bus, and a specific connection in order to interact with an object through its methods.">
</div>

A bus is the actual medium that serves as a carrier of all messages.
Generally, a machine will have at least a `system` and `session` bus which, for
example, would be accessible through a unix-domain socket expressed as a
unix-domain path or a TCP connection expressed by hostname and port. :bus:

A connection is addressed by a _bus name_. The naming is slightly confusing but
bear with me for a moment as I attempt to clarify. A _bus name_ is the
_connection's bus name_ (i.e.: name of the connection on the bus) and not the
connection _bus's name_.

Within a connection one may expect to find objects that contain members.
Interfaces, as in OOP, specify members and can as a whole be implemented by an
object. :wink:

To illustrate, the [D-Bus Specification][dbus-spec], specifies a `org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames`
member for the `org.freedesktop.DBus` object, which lists the names currently
registered on the bus. We could execute

```bash
dbus-send \
  --session \
  --dest=org.freedesktop.DBus \
  --type=method_call \
  --print-reply \
  /org/freedesktop/DBus \
  org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames
```

to get a listing of names on the session bus. The command is pretty
self-explanatory but humor me for a moment. The `--session` flag indicates that
we intent to communicate with the session bus, whereas the `--system` would
indicate that we intent to communicate with the system bus. The `--dest` argument
specifies the __bus name__, therefore specifying which connection on the bus we
are targeting. With `--type` we specify we are issuing a `method_call` --
another valid type is that of a `signal`. In our case we need a reply printed,
hence the `--print-reply`. The object we are interacting with and the member of
that object or the message name are the next two arguments respectively.

A quick read of the [Introduction to D-Bus][dbus-intro] article, mentions
activations as a mechanism for triggering an executable. Basically activations
allow for a service to subscribe to a given type of message in order to trigger
an executable (if it isn't already running) upon the delivery of a message.

 1. `dbus-daemon --system` (PID: 1030)
 1. `dbus-launch --exit-with-session` (PID: 1560)
 1. `dbus-daemon --session` (PID: 1575)

Installing `dbus-map`

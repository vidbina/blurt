description: My experiences during my first stroll into the world of OpenGL.

My experience in submerging myself in the world of OpenGL for the very first 
time has been somewhat of a breeze. Mind you I'm not there yet, better 
yet&hellip; I'm not even close, but I suppose it really helped to think of 
OpenGL as a untameable monster and then discovering that the monster, is a 
rather impressive beast, but not quite the Godzilla I had in mind.

## What is It?
OpenGL is a standard devised to allow the platform dependent construction of
2D/3D graphics. In short, regardless of the platform being used, OpenGL will
work the same way. A lot of the magic exhibited in the OpenGL circus, is made
possible by the processing units on graphics adapters which means that the
availability of OpenGL supporting hardware is the only real precondition in
OpenGL land.

With OpenGL, I'm basically capable of sending the graphics processing unit a 
description of the graphics I yearn to see, and rest assured that the GPU will
take care of the necessary steps in rendering my dream unto the canvas 
(screen/whatever).

## Basics

[OpenGL]: open.gl/drawing

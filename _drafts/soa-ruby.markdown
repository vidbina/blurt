It is perhaps purely by coincidence that [Kareem](https://github.com/kareemk) 
and [Nico](https://github.com/nviennot) chose _promiscuous_ as the name-to-be
for their [solution](https://github.com/promiscuous-io/promiscuous) that 
facilitates _indiscriminate_ intercommunication between software elements in a 
system/infrastructure.

I'm about to embark on a mission to engineer a SOA which subsequently led me to
the promiscuous framework. My basic idea was to start off with RESTful 
interfaces between the individual services, but promiscuous might get me on 
track to something much cooler.

<blockquote>
Interesting fact: SOA is the acronym for STD in the dutch language. In that 
regards the association between SOA&rsquo;s and promiscuity is very obvious unless
the proper precautions are exercised {{ :wink: | emojify }}.
